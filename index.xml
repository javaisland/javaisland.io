      <title>Better use of Java thread pool</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/thread-pool-tips/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:57:29 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/thread-pool-tips/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article combines the JUC package provided by Doug Lea in JDK1.5 to understand the use of thread pools from the setting of thread pool size parameters, the creation of work threads, the recycling of idle threads, the use of blocking queues, task rejection strategies, thread pool Hook and other aspects, which involves some details including the choice of different parameters, different queues, different rejection strategies, the resulting The details include the different parameters, the different queues, the choice of different rejection strategies, the resulting impact and behavior, and for better use of the thread pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ExecutorService is based on pooled threads to execute user submitted tasks, usually simply by creating ThreadPoolExecutor instances via the factory methods provided by Executors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thread pooling solves two problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thread pooling optimizes system performance when executing a large number of asynchronous tasks by reducing the performance consumption incurred each time a task is performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thread pooling also provides a way to limit and manage the resources and threads consumed when batch tasks are executed. In addition ThreadPoolExecutor provides simple statistics such as how many tasks have been executed so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;quick-start&#34;&gt;Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make the thread pool suitable for a large number of different application contexts, ThreadPoolExecutor provides a number of configurable parameters and hooks that can be used to extend it. However, users can also quickly create ThreadPoolExecutor instances by using some of the factory methods provided by Executors. For example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using Executors#newCachedThreadPool you can quickly create a thread pool with automatic thread recycling and no limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use Executors#newFixedThreadPool to create a fixed thread size thread pool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor to create a single-threaded executor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the instance created by the above method does not meet our needs, we can configure it ourselves with parameters to instantiate an instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-you-need-to-know-about-setting-the-thread-count-size-parameter&#34;&gt;What you need to know about setting the thread count size parameter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor dynamically adjusts the size of the thread pool based on corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize:poolSize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a task is submitted to the thread pool through the executor, we need to know the following points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the number of worker threads in the current pool is less than corePoolSize at this time, a new worker thread is created to execute the task, regardless of whether there are threads in the worker thread collection that are idle. If there are threads in the pool, then a new thread is created to execute the task, regardless of whether there are threads in the worker set that are idle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a worker thread in the pool that is larger than the corePoolSize but smaller than the maximumPoolSize, the task will be first tried to be put into the queue, and two cases need to be mentioned separately here:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the task is successfully put into the queue, see if a new thread needs to be opened to execute the task. Only when the current number of threads is 0 will a new thread be created, because the previous threads may be removed because they are idle or because the work is finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only go ahead and create a new worker thread if it fails to be put into the queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize are the same, the size of the thread pool is fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By setting maximumPoolSize to infinity, we can get a thread pool with no upper limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to setting these thread pool parameters via the construction parameters we can also set them at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;corethreadwarmup&#34;&gt;CoreThreadWarmUp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, core worker threads are created initially and started when a new task arrives, but we can change this behavior by overriding the restartCoreThread or restartCoreThreads methods. The usual scenario is that we can WarmUp the core thread when the application is started, thus achieving the result of being able to execute the task immediately when it comes, making the initial task processing time somewhat optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;custom-work-thread-creation&#34;&gt;Custom work thread creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New threads are created via ThreadFactory, if not specified, the default Executors#defaultThreadFactory will be used, at this time the created threads will all belong to the same thread group, with the same priority and daemon status. Extending the configuration of ThreadFactory, we can configure the thread name, thread combination daemon status. If the call to ThreadFactory#createThread fails, it will return null and the executor will not perform any task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;idle-thread-recycling&#34;&gt;Idle thread recycling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the number of worker threads in the current pool is greater than corePoolSize, and if the threads above this number are idle for longer than keepAliveTime, these threads will be terminated as a strategy to reduce unnecessary resource consumption. This parameter can be changed at runtime, and we can also apply this policy to core threads, which we can do by calling allowCoreThreadTimeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choosing-the-right-blocking-queue&#34;&gt;Choosing the right blocking queue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All blocking queues can be used to hold tasks, but using different queues for corePoolSize will exhibit different behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the number of worker threads in the pool is less than corePoolSize, a new worker thread will be created each time a task comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the number of worker threads in the pool is greater than or equal to corePoolSize, each time a task comes in, it first tries to put the thread into the queue instead of creating the thread directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the queue fails and the number of threads in the pool is less than the maximumPoolSize, then a worker thread is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are mainly the different queueing strategies performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;direct-submission&#34;&gt;Direct Submission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better default option is to use SynchronousQueue, a strategy that delivers the submitted task directly to the worker thread without holding it. If there is currently no worker thread to process it, i.e., the task fails to be placed in the queue, a new worker thread is triggered to be created according to the thread pool implementation, so the newly submitted task is processed. This strategy avoids lock contention consumption when there are dependencies between the submitted batch of tasks. It is worth mentioning that this strategy is best used in conjunction with the number of unbounded threads, thus avoiding task rejection. Also we have to consider a scenario when tasks arrive faster than they can be processed, which will cause the number of unbounded threads to keep increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;unbounded-queues&#34;&gt;Unbounded Queues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an unbounded queue such as LinkedBlockingQueue without specifying a maximum capacity will cause new tasks to be placed on the queue when the core threads are all busy, so that no threads larger than corePoolSize will ever be created, and therefore the maximumPoolSize parameter will fail. This strategy is more suitable for all tasks that are not dependent on each other and execute independently. As an example, for example, in a web server, each thread processes requests independently. But when the task processing speed is less than the task entry speed it will cause infinite expansion of the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bounded-queues&#34;&gt;Bounded Queues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bounded queues such as ArrayBlockingQueue help to limit the consumption of resources, but are not easy to control. The two values of queue length and maximumPoolSize affect each other. Using a large queue and a small maximumPoolSize will reduce CPU usage, OS resources, and context switching consumption, but will reduce throughput. If tasks are blocked frequently such as IO threads, the system can actually schedule more threads. Using a small queue usually requires a large maximumPoolSize, which makes the CPU a little busier, but increases the consumption of thread scheduling that reduces throughput. To summarize is IO-intensive can consider more threads to balance the CPU usage, CPU-intensive can consider less threads to reduce the consumption of thread scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;choose-a-suitable-rejection-strategy&#34;&gt;Choose a suitable rejection strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When new tasks arrive and the thread pool is closed, or when the number of threads and queues have reached the upper limit, we need to make a decision on how to reject these tasks. The following is a description of the common strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor#AbortPolicy: This policy directly throws a RejectedExecutionException exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor#CallerRunsPolicy: This policy will use the Caller thread to execute the task, which is a feedback policy that slows down the task submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor#DiscardPolicy: This policy will simply discard the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor#DiscardOldestPolicy: This policy will discard the task at the head of the task queue and then retry to execute it, and if it still fails, continue with the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above policies, we can also implement our own policies by implementing RejectedExecutionHandler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;embedding-your-behavior-with-hook&#34;&gt;Embedding your behavior with Hook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor provides hook methods of type protected that can be overridden, allowing the user to do something after the task will be executed before it is executed. We can use it to implement operations such as initializing ThreadLocal, collecting statistics, such as logging, etc. There is another hook that can be used to allow the user to insert logic when the task is finished being executed, such as rerminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the hook method fails to execute, the execution of the internal worker thread will fail or be interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessible-queues&#34;&gt;Accessible Queues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The getQueue method can be used to access the queue for some statistical or debug work, but we do not recommend it for other purposes. Also the remove and purge methods can be used to remove tasks from the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-the-thread-pool&#34;&gt;Closing the thread pool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thread pool will be terminated when it is not referenced anymore and the number of working threads is 0. We can also call shutdown to manually terminate the thread pool. If we forget to call shutdown, we can also use keepAliveTime and allowCoreThreadTimeOut in order to get the thread resources released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;written-at-the-end&#34;&gt;Written at the end&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API provided by JAVA itself already allows us to quickly do multi-threaded development based on thread pools, but we have to be responsible for the code we write, and each parameter setting and strategy choice has an absolute relationship with different application scenarios. However, it is not easy to choose different parameters and different strategies. We have to answer some basic questions first: what does the OS do for us for each thread created, and what is the main part of the OS resource consumption for this thread? If my application scenario is IO-intensive, do I need more threads or fewer threads? In my opinion, multi-threaded development is a not easy thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Technology Trends Java Teams Should Watch in 2022</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-2022-trends/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 15:33:15 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-2022-trends/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Java is evolving quickly, and with potential changes to the OpenJDK release cycle, it may accelerate even further. For people like Michael Rasmussen, JRebel development lead at Perforce, keeping up with these changes and understanding their impact on development; creating features that resonate with the Java development community, keeping applications up to date with the latest versions of popular Java technologies, and developing new features, improvements, and integrations for JRebel is critical. and integrations for JRebel is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDTimes conducted an interview with Michael to discuss in detail the Java trends the team should be looking at during 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/11/9bc50829705849fe8d02854b75f01d8b.png&#34; alt=&#34;developer picture&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, in terms of release adoption size, Michael says that Java 8 is a release that has driven significant growth in adoption because it includes some major feature additions. Java 17, on the other hand, has not seen such significant changes, and while there are many benefits for Java 8 users to migrate to Java 17, it is unlikely to drive teams to do so on a large scale. So Java 17 adoption is unlikely to reach the scale of Java 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after looking at the release roadmap and the status of various Java enhancement projects, Michael believes that the next major adoption event we will see in Java will be related to the Valhalla project and the addition of value types to the language. However, even given the faster LTS release cadence, Michael speculates that this will be in the post-Java 25 LTS release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael notes that the change in release cadence has not been formalized, but given that all the major OpenJDK vendors are now on board, it is likely that the LTS release cadence will change from every three years to every two years. This move will have a huge impact on the Java ecosystem; one of the long-term effects will be that fewer users will adopt non-LTS versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Essentially, why would you want to adopt an intermediate version when you can wait less than two years to adopt an LTS version that has the features you need? It&amp;rsquo;s not that people don&amp;rsquo;t adopt non-LTS versions - it&amp;rsquo;s just that most Java teams can&amp;rsquo;t afford to upgrade to the latest version at release time. On the other hand, the fast release cadence means that small upgrades are usually problem-free upgrades. If you have a project, or you&amp;rsquo;re starting one, it&amp;rsquo;s best to aim for an LTS version that aligns with the expected project release and use the latest non-LTS version for the duration of development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the upcoming 2022 release of Java 18 and 19, Michael, for his part, said that among the features to watch for should be the external function interface and the vector API. &amp;ldquo;I hope that both of those features will be finalized in Java 19. On the language side, I think we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to see more and more enhancements to pattern matching.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, given that JRebel conducts an annual survey of the Java industry, Michael said that the technology trends shown in this year&amp;rsquo;s report will include the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the framework level, microservices frameworks such as Micronaut and Quarkus will continue to take market share on Spring Boot. However, given that Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 are scheduled for release in the second half of 2022, Spring will not go down without a fight. Another thing to consider with the new Spring releases is that they will target Java 17 and Jakarta EE 9, a move that will also likely help drive adoption of Java 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the IDE side, IntelliJ IDEA will still be the most used one, but there will be more VSCode as a secondary or even primary tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;core-related-classes&#34;&gt;Core related classes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HikariDataSource class&lt;/code&gt; : brings together information related to the description of the data source, such as configuration, connection pool, connection object, state management, etc..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HikariConfig class&lt;/code&gt; : maintain the configuration of the data source management, and parameter verification, such as userName, passWord, minIdle, maxPoolSize, etc..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HikariPool class&lt;/code&gt;: provides the core ability to manage connection pools and objects in the pool, and implements query methods for pool-related monitoring data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ConcurrentBag class&lt;/code&gt; : abandon the blocking queue used in the conventional pool as a container, customize the concurrent container to store connection objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PoolEntry class&lt;/code&gt; : extends information about connection objects, such as status, time, etc., to facilitate tracking of these instantiated objects in the container.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the analysis of several core classes in the connection pool, you can also intuitively appreciate the design principles of the source code, and the previous summary of the application of the object pool has similarities, but different components of different developers in the implementation of the time, have their own abstract logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;loading-logic&#34;&gt;Loading logic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the configuration information to build the data source description, in the construction method based on the configuration and then to instantiate the connection pool, in the construction of HikariPool, instantiate the ConcurrentBag container object; the following and then analyze the implementation details from the source code level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;container-analysis&#34;&gt;Container analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;container-structure&#34;&gt;Container structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Container ConcurrentBag class provides the PoolEntry type of connected object storage, as well as basic element management capabilities, object state description; although held by the HikariPool object pool class, but the actual logic of the operation is in the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;basic-properties&#34;&gt;Basic properties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most central of these are &lt;code&gt;sharedList&lt;/code&gt; shared collections, &lt;code&gt;threadList&lt;/code&gt; thread-level caches, and &lt;code&gt;handoffQueue&lt;/code&gt; instant queues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;state-description&#34;&gt;State Description&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IConcurrentBagEntry internal interface in the ConcurrentBag class, implemented by the PoolEntry class, which defines the state of the connection object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATE_NOT_IN_USE&lt;/code&gt;: unused, i.e., inactive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATE_IN_USE&lt;/code&gt;: in use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATE_REMOVED&lt;/code&gt;: deprecated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;STATE_RESERVED&lt;/code&gt;: reserved state, intermediate state, used when trying to evict a connected object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;packaging-objects&#34;&gt;Packaging objects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the basic ability of the container is used to store the connection object, while the management of the object requires a lot of extended tracking information to effectively complete the identification of various scenarios, at which point it is necessary to resort to the introduction of packaging classes;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here it should be noted that the FastList class implements the List interface, customized for HiKariCP components, compared to the ArrayList class, for the pursuit of performance, in the management of the elements, to remove the many range checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;object-management&#34;&gt;Object management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the conventional use of connection pools to see how the connection object is specifically managed, such as being lent, released, discarded, etc., as well as the state transition process of objects under these operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;initialization&#34;&gt;initialization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above &lt;strong&gt;loading logic&lt;/strong&gt; description, has been mentioned in the construction of the data source, will be instantiated according to the configuration of the connection pool, at the time of initialization, based on two core entry points to analyze the source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how many connection objects are instantiated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;connection object conversion packaging object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;checkFailFast&lt;/code&gt; method is executed in the connection pool construction, within which the MinIdle minimum idle number judgment is performed, and if it is greater than 0, a wrapper object is created and placed in the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;PoolEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;poolEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;createPoolEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getMinimumIdle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;connectionBag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;poolEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two issues need to be noted, the creation of the connection wrapper object, the initial state is 0 that is idle; in addition, although the case set the value of &lt;code&gt;MinIdle=4&lt;/code&gt;, but here the judgment is greater than 0, but also only in the container in advance put a free object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;borrowed-objects&#34;&gt;Borrowed Objects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When fetching the connection object from the pool, the &lt;code&gt;borrow&lt;/code&gt; method in the container class is actually called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When executing the &lt;code&gt;borrow&lt;/code&gt; method, the following core steps and logic are involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// Reduce the number of waiting threads

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;first reverse iterate through the local thread cache and return the object if an idle connection exists; if not, look for the Shared collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before traversing the Shared shared collection, it marks the number of waiting threads plus one, and returns it directly if there is an idle connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When there is no idle connection in the Shared shared collection either, then the current thread performs &lt;code&gt;handoffQueue&lt;/code&gt; queue polling for a certain amount of time, possibly with the release of resources, or with newly added resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that here, when traversing the collection, the objects taken out are judged and updated for status, and if a free object is obtained, it is updated to &lt;code&gt;IN_USE&lt;/code&gt; status and returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;releasing-objects&#34;&gt;Releasing objects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When releasing a connected object from the pool, the &lt;code&gt;requite&lt;/code&gt; method in the container class is actually called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;HikariPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;recycle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;PoolEntry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;poolEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ConcurrentBag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;request&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bagEntry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When releasing the connection object, first update the object state to idle, then determine whether there is currently a waiting thread, in the &lt;code&gt;borrow&lt;/code&gt; method waiting thread will enter a certain time polling, if not then the object into the local thread cache:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that the state of the connection object involved here from use to &lt;code&gt;NOT_IN_USE&lt;/code&gt; idle; &lt;code&gt;borrow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;requite&lt;/code&gt; as the two core methods in the connection pool, responsible for resource creation and recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although only part of the source code, but already enough to highlight the author&amp;rsquo;s ultimate pursuit of performance, such as: local thread cache, custom container types, FastList, etc.; can be commonly adopted must exist many reasons to support.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synchronized keywords in java concurrency</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-synchronized/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 10:26:19 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-synchronized/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a multi-threaded environment, we often encounter resource competition, such as multiple threads going to modify the same shared variable at the same time, it is necessary to perform some processing of the resource access method to ensure that only one thread accesses it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java provides the &lt;code&gt;synchronized&lt;/code&gt; keyword to facilitate us to achieve the above operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-synchronized&#34;&gt;Why synchronized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example where we create a class that provides a setSum method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;SynchronizedMethods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;calculate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;setSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;getSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we call this calculate method in a multi-threaded environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;givenMultiThread_whenNonSyncMethod&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newFixedThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SynchronizedMethods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;summation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SynchronizedMethods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;IntStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;summation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;calculate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shutdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;awaitTermination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;MILLISECONDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;assertEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;summation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the above method, we expect to return 1000, but in practice it is basically impossible to get the value of 1000 because of the negative impact of simultaneous operations on the same resource in a multi-threaded environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we build a thread-safe environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;synchronized-keyword&#34;&gt;Synchronized keyword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java provides a variety of thread-safe methods, this article focuses on the &lt;code&gt;Synchronized&lt;/code&gt; keyword, &lt;code&gt;Synchronized&lt;/code&gt; keyword can have many forms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instance methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we use &lt;code&gt;synchronized&lt;/code&gt;, java will add a lock on the corresponding object, so that the methods waiting for the lock on the same object must be executed sequentially, thus ensuring thread safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;synchronized-instance-methods&#34;&gt;Synchronized Instance Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Synchronized keyword can be placed in front of the instance method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;synchronisedCalculate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;setSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;getSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at the result of the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;givenMultiThread_whenMethodSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newFixedThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SynchronizedMethods&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SynchronizedMethods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;IntStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;synchronisedCalculate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;awaitTermination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;MILLISECONDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;assertEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;method&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here &lt;code&gt;synchronized&lt;/code&gt; will lock the instance object of the method, and only the thread that gets the lock on the instance object will be able to execute it in multiple threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;synchronized-static-methods&#34;&gt;Synchronized Static Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Synchronized&lt;/code&gt; keyword can also be used in front of static methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;syncStaticCalculate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;staticSum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;staticSum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synchronized in front of a static method locks a different object than in front of an instance method. The object locked in front of the static method is the Class itself, because there is only one Class in the JVM, so no matter how many instances of the Class there are, there will only be one thread that can execute the method at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shutdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;awaitTermination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;MILLISECONDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;assertEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SynchronizedMethods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;staticSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;synchronized-blocks&#34;&gt;Synchronized Blocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we may not need to Synchronize the whole method, but a part of it, when we can use &lt;code&gt;Synchronized&lt;/code&gt; Blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;assertEquals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;synchronizedBlocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getSum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above we synchronize the instance, if in a static method we can also synchronize the class.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we will discuss the difference between wait() and sleep() methods in java. And discuss how to use these two methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;difference-between-wait-and-sleep&#34;&gt;Difference between wait and sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wait() is a native method defined in Object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;native&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;wait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;timeout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So every instance of the class can call this method. wait() can only be called in a synchronized block. It will release the lock put on the object when it is synchronized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sleep() is a native static class method that defines Thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;native&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;millis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Thread.sleep() can be called in any case. thread.sleep() will suspend the current thread and will not release any lock resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a simple use of wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;WaitExample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34; waiting for 1 second&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the use of sleep again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Thread &amp;#39;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;currentThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                        &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#39; is woken after sleeping for 1 second&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wake-up-wait-and-sleep&#34;&gt;Wake up wait and sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sleep() method comes with a sleep time, after which the Thread will be woken up automatically.
Or it can be interrupted by calling the interrupt() method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to wait, waking up is a bit more complicated, as we need to call notify() and notifyAll() to wake up the threads waiting on a specific wait object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;notify() selects a thread to wake up based on the thread scheduling mechanism, while notifyAll() wakes up all the waiting threads, which will then re-claim the resource lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wait,notity is usually used in producer and consumer situations, let&amp;rsquo;s see how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JNA, in order to map with native functions, we can have two mapping methods, the first one is interface mapping and the second one is direct mapping. Although the two approaches are different, in the specific method mapping, we both need to define a method in JAVA that maps to the native method..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This JAVA mapping is a function in JNA, and by using a function object, we can achieve some very powerful functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;function-definition&#34;&gt;function definition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First look at the definition of Function in JNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Pointer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see that Function is actually a Pointer, which points to a native function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you get an instance of Function?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the JNA process is to map the Library first, and then map the Function in the Library. So naturally we should be able to get the Function from the Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the definition of the method to get an instance of function according to Library name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method can accept 4 parameters, the first two parameters should be familiar, the third parameter is callFlags, which is the flags of the function call, Function defines three callFlags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;C_CONVENTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ALT_CONVENTION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0x3F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;THROW_LAST_ERROR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0x40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;C_CONVENTION&lt;/code&gt; indicates a method call of type C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ALT_CONVENTION&lt;/code&gt; indicates the other call methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;THROW_LAST_ERROR&lt;/code&gt; means that a LastErrorException will be thrown if the return value of the native function is non-zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last parameter is encoding, which is the encoding of the string, and actually refers to the conversion between Java unicode and native (const char*) strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to getting Function according to Library name, JNA also provides a way to get Function according to Pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;getFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Pointer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;callFlags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;callFlags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;encoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pointer here is a pointer to a native method, because Function itself is inherited from Pointer, so the essence of creating Function with Pointer is to add some Function-specific properties on top of Pointer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the definition of Function, the more important thing is how to call the corresponding method through Function. Similar to reflection, Function also has an invoke method, and by calling invoke, we can execute the corresponding Function function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of invoke methods in Function, one is the generic object Object, and the other is the invoke method with return value, such as invokeString, invokePointer, invokeInt, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;functions-practical-application&#34;&gt;Function&amp;rsquo;s practical application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual use of Function is somewhat similar to reflection in JAVA. The workflow is to first get the NativeLibrary to be loaded, then find the Function to be called from the NativeLibrary, and finally invoke some of the Function&amp;rsquo;s methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C language printf should be the most familiar native method. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to use Function to call this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;NativeLibrary&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;NativeLibrary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;C_LIBRARY_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getFunction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;printf&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;invoke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;getClass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Invalid return types should throw an exception&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// expected
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see the flow of the call is very concise. If we are using interface Mapping or direct Mapping, we also need to customize an interface or class and define a corresponding java method mapping in it. But if we use Function, none of this is needed. We can get the corresponding function directly from NativeLibrary and finally call the method in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype of printf in C is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;# include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;int printf(const char *format, ...) ;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;printf comes with a return value, and to output this return value, you can call the function&amp;rsquo;s invokeInt command. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at another example of a call with a return value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;summarize&#34;&gt;Summarize&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Function can reduce the work of handwriting Mapping, which is very useful in some cases, but Function&amp;rsquo;s invoke supports TypeMapper, not FunctionMapper, so there are still some limitations in using it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java Zombie Processes Continued</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-zombie-processes-continued/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Apr 2022 15:26:12 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-zombie-processes-continued/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-zombie-processes/&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned the problem of Java program containers generating a lot of zombie processes. Today I ran into it again, but in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zombie processes are also generated by a bash script, but this script is executed in the K8S readinessProbe and livenessProbe, not by the java program itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some failure diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/09/c6e606853d88474e93fee81a9525f6ca.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/09/86adc81f0199446b9c00a2b937dd6249.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/09/b560ca55e2ca451ea88f989e24eb0bf6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/09/dee39d812ab94c44b668d0e6fae26697.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/09/1f1c74d192e148ec8cf79ab0ae3ecc8c.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/09/202e4d91f1014b908a44a9eb69d2cdd0.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that there are many timeout processes that are not cleaned up after execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And readinessProbe and livenessProbe look like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;readinessProbe:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  exec:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    command:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    - sh
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    -c
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    - /health/ping_readiness_local.sh 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;livenessProbe:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  exec:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    command:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    - sh
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    -c
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    - /health/ping_liveness_local.sh 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    ...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a series of troubleshooting, I found out that it has something to do with the &lt;code&gt;ENTRYPOINT of&lt;/code&gt; the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base image is &lt;code&gt;openjdk:8-alpine&lt;/code&gt;, and the original one looks like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENTRYPOINT [&amp;quot;/home/java-app/docker-entrypoint.sh&amp;quot;]
Change to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;RUN apk add --no-cache --update tini
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ENTRYPOINT &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/sbin/tini&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;--&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/home/java-app/docker-entrypoint.sh&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krallin/tini&#34;&gt;tini&lt;/a&gt; prevents containers from spawning zombie processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. So far the bot process problem is often found on &lt;code&gt;alpine&lt;/code&gt; images.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java introduces preview virtual threads</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-virtual-threads/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 13:14:35 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-virtual-threads/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenJDK&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/425&#34;&gt;JEP 425: Virtual Threads (Preview)&lt;/a&gt; feature proposal shows that the Java platform will introduce the virtual threads feature. Virtual threads are lightweight threads that can significantly reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java developers have always relied on threads as the building blocks of concurrent server applications, where statements in each method are executed within a thread, and each thread provides a stack to store local variables and coordinate method calls, as well as context trapping when errors are reported. Threads are the concurrent unit of Java and the core foundation of Java tools: the debugger executes statements in threaded methods incrementally, and the parser visualizes the behavior of multiple threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the JDK implements its platform threads as wrappers for operating system (OS) threads, where each instance of the JDK is a platform thread that runs Java code on the underlying OS thread and captures OS threads throughout the life of the code. The number of platform threads is limited by the number of OS threads, which are costly and cannot take up too much. As a result, this current approach to the JDK&amp;rsquo;s threading implementation limits the throughput of its applications to well below the level supported by the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/08/b1e85feea6f34eb592df196550a901c7.png&#34; alt=&#34;Virtual Threads&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-virtual-threads&#34;&gt;About virtual threads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual threads &lt;code&gt;java.lang.Thread&lt;/code&gt; are threads that run Java code on the underlying operating system thread (OS thread), but do not capture instances of the OS thread for the entire lifetime of the code. This means that many virtual threads can run Java code on the same OS thread, thus effectively sharing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual threads are lightweight implementations of threads provided by the JDK rather than the OS, and are a form of &lt;strong&gt;user-mode threads&lt;/strong&gt;. User mode threads were known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;green threads&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; in earlier versions of Java , when the concept of OS threads was not mature and popular enough and all green threads in Java shared an OS thread (M:1 scheduling). As the concept of threads evolved, green threads were eventually overtaken by the current platform threads, implemented as wrappers for OS threads (1:1 scheduling), while the newly introduced virtual threads use M:N scheduling, where a large number (M) of virtual threads are scheduled to run on a smaller number (N) of OS threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;higher-throughput&#34;&gt;Higher throughput&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can choose whether to use virtual threads or platform threads, but virtual threads perform better in high-throughput server applications. For example, the following code that sleeps for one second creates a large number of virtual threads, and the program first gets an &lt;a href=&#34;https://download.java.net/java/early_access/loom/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html&#34;&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/a&gt;, which creates a new virtual thread for each submitted task, then submits 10000 tasks and waits for all of them to complete:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;ofSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// executor.close() is called implicitly, and waits
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern hardware can easily support 10,000 virtual threads running such code simultaneously. If the program uses an ExecutorService that creates a new platform thread for each task, such as Executors.newCachedThreadPool(), then it will try to create 10,000 platform threads, which means 10,000 OS threads, and the program will crash on most operating systems. Or maybe the program uses an ExecutorService that gets the platform threads from a pool, like Executors.newFixedThreadPool(200), which is not much better. The ExecutorService will create 200 platform threads to be shared by the 10,000 tasks, which will run sequentially instead of simultaneously, taking the program a long time to run through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the above program, a pool with 200 platform threads would only achieve a throughput of 200 tasks per second, while virtual threads would achieve a throughput of about 10,000 tasks per second (after a full warm-up). In addition, if you change 10,000 in the example program to 1,000,000, the program will submit 1,000,000 tasks, create 1,000,000 concurrently running virtual threads, and (after full warm-up) achieve a throughput of about 1,000,000 tasks/second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, virtual threads are not faster threads &amp;ndash; they do not run code faster than platform threads. They exist to provide scale (higher throughput), not speed (lower latency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-enable-virtual-threads&#34;&gt;How do I enable virtual threads?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual threads are currently widely used in other multi-threaded languages (e.g. goroutine in Go and process in Erlang, and are a stable feature in C++), but are still a preview API in Java and disabled by default. To try this feature on JDK XX, you must enable the preview API by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compiling the program with &lt;code&gt;javac --release XX --enable-preview Main.java&lt;/code&gt; and running it with &lt;code&gt;java --enable-preview Main&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using the source launcher, run the program with &lt;code&gt;java --release XX --enable-preview Main.java&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When using jshell, start with &lt;code&gt;jshell --enable-preview&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about virtual threads can be found in the OpenJDK&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8277131&#34;&gt;JDK Issue-8277131&lt;/a&gt;, which was currently created on 2021/11/15 and is still in the first phase of the JEP process and is still some time away from a stable release.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Application of Volatile</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/volatile-application/</link>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;memory-visibility&#34;&gt;Memory Visibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Java Memory Model (JMM) states that all variables are stored in main memory, and each thread has its own working memory (cache).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a thread is working, it needs to copy the data from the main memory to the working memory. This way, any operation on the data is based on the working memory (which is more efficient) and cannot directly manipulate the data in the main memory or the working memory of other threads, and then flush the updated data to the main memory afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main memory mentioned here can be simply thought of as heap memory, while the working memory can be thought of as stack memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/07/0130700b0ede4bbe9a9798a848afcbce.png&#34; alt=&#34;Memory Read Map&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So during concurrent operation it may happen that the data read by thread B is the data before the update by thread A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is a problem, and volatile can solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a variable is modified with volatile, writes to it by any thread are immediately flushed to main memory and force the thread that cached the variable to clear the data and have to read the latest data from main memory again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volatile modification does not allow threads to fetch data directly from main memory; they still need to copy the variable into working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;application-of-memory-visibility&#34;&gt;Application of Memory Visibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we need to communicate between two threads based on main memory, the variable to be communicated with must be modified with volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;The main thread has exited!&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main thread has modified the flag bit to make thread A stop immediately, which could be delayed if not modified with volatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a misconception here that such use tends to give the impression that Concurrent operations on volatile-modified variables are thread-safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few words of clarification here: &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee thread safety!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;t2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;finalCount=&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have three threads (t1,t2,main) accumulating an int at the same time, we find that the final value is less than 30000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because although volatile ensures memory visibility and each thread gets the latest value, the count ++ operation is not atomic, and the operations involved in getting the value, self-incrementing, and assigning the value cannot be done at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you want to achieve thread safety, you can make the three threads execute serially (which is actually single-threaded and does not take advantage of multi-threading).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also use synchronize or lock to ensure atomicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also replace int with AtomicInteger from the Atomic package, which uses the CAS algorithm to guarantee atomicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;instruction-rearrangement&#34;&gt;Instruction rearrangement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory visibility is only one of the semantics of volatile, it also prevents the JVM from performing instruction rearrangement optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a pseudo-code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particularly simple piece of code, which ideally would be executed in the order 1&amp;gt;2&amp;gt;3, may be optimized by the JVM to execute in the order 2&amp;gt;1&amp;gt;3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that no matter how the JVM is optimized, the premise is to ensure that the final result remains the same in a single thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t see the problem here, look at the next piece of pseudo-code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;volatile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fasle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// The following method occurs in thread A Initialize Map
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;initMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// time consuming operation
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;getMapValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// occur in thread B wait until the Map initialization success for other operations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;doSomeThing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//dosomething
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;doSomeThing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that when the flag is not modified by volatile, the JVM reorders 1 and 2, resulting in the value being used by thread B before it is even initialized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So adding volatile prevents this kind of reordering optimization and ensures correctness of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;application-of-instruction-reordering&#34;&gt;Application of instruction reordering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A classic use case is the double lazy loading singleton pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;volatile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;singleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;getInstance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;singleton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;synchronized&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;singleton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//prevent instruction reordering
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;singleton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Singleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;singleton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volatile keyword here is mainly to prevent instruction reordering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t use , singleton = new Singleton();, this code is actually divided into three steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate memory space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initialize the object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point the singleton object to the allocated memory address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding volatile is to let the above three steps in order to execute the operation, otherwise it is possible that the second step is executed before the third step, it is possible that a thread gets the singleton object is not yet initialized, so it reports an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;volatile is used a lot in Java concurrency, such as the value in the Atomic package, and the state in the AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer are defined as volatile to ensure memory visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ReentrantLock implementation principle</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/reentrantlock-principle/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 16:30:46 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/reentrantlock-principle/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When using &lt;code&gt;synchronize&lt;/code&gt; to do synchronization, lock acquisition and release are implicitly implemented by compiling and adding different machine instructions to achieve the principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/code&gt; is a class based on &lt;code&gt;AbstractQueuedSynchronizer&lt;/code&gt;(AQS for short) implementation, this article analyzes the implementation principle of &lt;code&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/code&gt;, I hope it will be helpful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/strong&gt;: a thread can still &lt;strong&gt;repeat&lt;/strong&gt; the lock after it has obtained it, and will not appear to block itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;AQS&lt;/code&gt; is an important basic framework for implementing locks and synchronization in the &lt;code&gt;Java&lt;/code&gt; concurrency package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lock-types&#34;&gt;Lock types&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReentrantLock is divided into &lt;strong&gt;fair locks&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;non-fair locks&lt;/strong&gt;, and the specific type can be specified via the constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// default non-fair lock
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sync&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;NonfairSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// Fair lock
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sync&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fair&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;FairSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;NonfairSync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default is generally to use &lt;strong&gt;NonfairLock&lt;/strong&gt; , which is much more efficient and throughput than fair locks (the exact reasons will be analyzed later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-locks&#34;&gt;Get locks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual way to use it is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//do bussiness
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;printStackTrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;unlock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;fair-lock-acquisition-lock&#34;&gt;Fair lock acquisition lock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First look at the process of acquiring a lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;sync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see that the method &lt;code&gt;sync&lt;/code&gt; is used, and this method is an abstract method, specifically implemented by its subclass ( &lt;code&gt;FairSync&lt;/code&gt;), and the following is the implementation of the fair lock:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//AbstractQueuedSynchronizer in acquire()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;acquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;tryAcquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;acquireQueued&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;addWaiter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;EXCLUSIVE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;arg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;selfInterrupt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to try to acquire a lock ( &lt;code&gt;tryAcquire(arg)&lt;/code&gt; ), which is also implemented by its subclasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;tryAcquire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;acquires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Maximum lock count exceeded&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to determine whether &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;AQS&lt;/code&gt; is equal to 0. 0 means that no other thread has obtained a lock, so the current thread can try to obtain a lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Before trying, the &lt;code&gt;hasQueuedPredecessors()&lt;/code&gt; method will be used to determine if there are other threads in the queue of AQS, if there are, no lock will be attempted ( &lt;strong&gt;This is the case for fair locks&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no thread in the queue, CAS is used to change the state in AQS to 1, which means that the lock is acquired, and if it succeeds, the current thread is set as the exclusive thread that acquired the lock ( &lt;code&gt;setExclusiveOwnerThread(current)&lt;/code&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; is greater than 0, the lock has already been acquired, so you need to determine if the thread that acquired the lock is the current thread ( &lt;code&gt;ReentrantLock&lt;/code&gt; supports reentry), and if so, you need to set &lt;code&gt;state + 1&lt;/code&gt; and update the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;write-to-queue&#34;&gt;Write to queue&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;tryAcquire(arg)&lt;/code&gt; fails to acquire a lock, you need to write the current thread to the queue with &lt;code&gt;addWaiter(Node.EXCLUSIVE)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to wrap the current thread as a &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; object ( &lt;code&gt;addWaiter(Node.EXCLUSIVE)&lt;/code&gt; ) before writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The queue in AQS is implemented as a bidirectional chain of Node nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrapper code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First determine if the queue is empty, if not then write the encapsulated &lt;code&gt;Node&lt;/code&gt; to the end of the queue using &lt;code&gt;CAS&lt;/code&gt;, if there is a concurrent write failure then you need to call &lt;code&gt;enq(node);&lt;/code&gt; to write it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;hanging-a-waiting-thread&#34;&gt;Hanging a waiting thread&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing to the queue the current thread needs to be hung (using &lt;code&gt;acquireQueued(addWaiter(Node.EXCLUSIVE), arg)&lt;/code&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it will get whether the previous node is the head node according to &lt;code&gt;node.predecessor()&lt;/code&gt;, if it is, it will try to acquire a lock once, and if it succeeds, everything will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is not the head node, or if the lock acquisition fails, it will be handled according to the &lt;code&gt;waitStatus&lt;/code&gt; status of the previous node ( &lt;code&gt;shouldParkAfterFailedAcquire(p, node)&lt;/code&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;waitStatus&lt;/code&gt; is used to record the status of the current node, such as node cancelled, node waiting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;shouldParkAfterFailedAcquire(p, node)&lt;/code&gt; returns whether the current thread needs to hang, and if so, calls &lt;code&gt;parkAndCheckInterrupt()&lt;/code&gt; : `&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is using the &lt;code&gt;part&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;LockSupport&lt;/code&gt; to hang the current thread until it is woken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-fair-locks-get-locks&#34;&gt;Non-fair locks get locks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between a fair lock and a non-fair lock is mainly in the acquisition of the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair locks need to be used in sequential order. Non-fair locks, on the other hand, do not have these rules and are &lt;strong&gt;preemption mode&lt;/strong&gt; , which directly attempts to acquire the lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-fair locks :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important difference is that when attempting to acquire a lock &lt;code&gt;tryAcquire(arg)&lt;/code&gt;, a non-fair lock does not need to determine if there are other threads in the queue, but also directly attempts to acquire the lock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;free&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;setExclusiveOwnerThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;        
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is to determine if the current thread is the thread that acquired the lock, and since it is a reentrant lock, you need to reduce &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; to 0 before you can consider the lock fully released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After releasing it, you need to call &lt;code&gt;unparkSuccessor(h)&lt;/code&gt; to wake up the hung thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since fair locks need to care about the queue, they need to acquire locks in the order of the queue (which causes a lot of thread context switching), while non-fair locks do not have this limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that explains why non-fair locks are more efficient than fair locks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Practical Applications of Reflection - Building Log Objects</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-reflect-application/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 16:16:21 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-reflect-application/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our practical development, we often use reflection, I present an example of the logging function done by reflection in practical development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;traditional-logging&#34;&gt;Traditional logging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some basic knowledge about reflection can be found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.javai.net/post/202203/java-reflect/&#34;&gt;Reflection Primer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that logging is not new to you, in the actual development of some more sensitive data tables we need to record every operation of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the traditional way of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;insertSelective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello JavaIsland&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setCreatedate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2022-04-06&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;contentService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;insertSelective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ContentLog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ContentLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setContentid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getContentid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello JavaIsland&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setCreatedate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2022-04-06&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;contentLogService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;insertSelective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is very simple to save the same data to the log table after saving the data table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this has several problems as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the data table has more fields, for example hundreds of them. Then the &lt;code&gt;setter()&lt;/code&gt; method of the log table will have to be written hundreds of times, and only if they are all correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a field is added to the data table one day, the field will have to be added in every place where the log is written, raising the cost of maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflection is needed to solve the above situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-logs-using-reflection&#34;&gt;Building logs using reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the changes to the code that result from using reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;nd&#34;&gt;@Test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;insertSelective2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello JavaIsland&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setContentname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;JavaIsland&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setCreatedate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2022-04-06&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;contentService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;insertSelective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ContentLog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ContentLog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CommonUtil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setLogValueModelToModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;contentLogService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;insertSelective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same save log, no matter how many fields, only three lines of code can be solved, and even if the fields change after writing the log this code still does not need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the main method here is &lt;code&gt;CommonUtil.setLogValueModelToModel(content, log);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how this is done;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;25
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;26
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;27
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;28
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;29
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;30
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;31

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;IllegalAccessException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we can use it again we first need to build the main data table and then &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; a log table object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;setLogValueModelToModel()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the class types of the data table and log table objects respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the set of all methods of the log object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterate through the collection and get the name of the method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take only the method that starts with set in it, which is the set method. Because we need to assign a value to each field of the log object in the loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After that, intercept the method name to get the specific field name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the previously intercepted field name, the &lt;code&gt;getMethod()&lt;/code&gt; method returns the &lt;code&gt;getter&lt;/code&gt; method for that field in the data table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is equivalent to executing &lt;code&gt;String content = content.getContent();&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute this method to get the specific value of the field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;setter&lt;/code&gt; method of the current loop to assign a value to each field of the log object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is equivalent to executing &lt;code&gt;log.setContent(&amp;quot;asdsf&amp;quot;);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the field name is &lt;code&gt;LogId&lt;/code&gt; and the current loop is skipped because LogId is the primary key of the log table and does not need to be assigned a value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the loop ends, the log object is also constructed. After that, you just need to save it to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflection is actually very resource-intensive and should be used with caution, and it is necessary to cache method, field, constructor and other objects.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to implement detection of undirected and directed loops in Java</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/detect-loops/</link>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;undirected-rings&#34;&gt;Undirected rings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An undirected graph with rings is shown below, where there are two rings, 0-2-1-0 and 2-3-4-2, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/06/bec982609990410eafa56fc996138cfc.png&#34; alt=&#34;undirected graph&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To detect rings in an undirected graph, you can use depth-first search. Suppose we start from vertex 0, then walk to the adjacent vertex 2, then walk to the vertex 1 adjacent to vertex 2. Since vertex 0 and vertex 1 are adjacent and vertex 0 is labeled, it means we have spared a loop, so there is a loop in the undirected graph. Although vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, it does not indicate the existence of a ring, because we go directly from vertex 2 to vertex 1, which is only an edge relationship. The algorithm is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of a directed graph is almost the same as the implementation of an undirected graph in the previous blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.javai.net/post/202204/undirected-graphs/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;How to Implement Undirected Graphs in Java&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, except that when adding edges v-w, only vertex w is added to the chain of vertices v, and the chain of vertices w is not without manipulating the chain table of vertex w. If you change the access rights of the member variables in &lt;code&gt;LinkGraph&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt;, you can simply inherit and override the &lt;code&gt;addEdge&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A directed graph containing a directed ring is shown below, where 5-4-3-5 form a ring of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/06/5221197ff3a74ca5a2de93e7c02e6737.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recursive implementation of depth-first search is used here to detect directed rings. Suppose we start at vertex 0, go through vertices 5, 4, and 3, and eventually come across vertex 5, which is adjacent to vertex 3. At this point, if we know that vertex 5 has been visited and the recursive function is still pressed on the stack, it means that the depth-first search starts at vertex 5 and goes back to vertex 5, i.e., it finds the directed ring. The algorithm is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-concepts&#34;&gt;Basic concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;definition-of-a-graph&#34;&gt;Definition of a graph&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graph is a binary consisting of a set of points V={vi}V={vi} and a set E={ek}E={ek} of unordered pairs of elements in VV, denoted G=(V,E)G=(V,E), elements vivi in VV are called vertices and elements ekek in EE are called edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For two points u,vu,v in VV, if the edge (u,v)(u,v) belongs to EE, then the two points u,vu,v are said to be adjacent and u,vu,v is called the endpoint of the edge (u,v)(u,v).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can denote the number of edges in the graph GG by m(G)=|E|m(G)=|E| and the number of vertices in the graph GG by n(G)=|V|n(G)=|V|.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;definition-of-an-undirected-graph&#34;&gt;Definition of an undirected graph&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any edge (vi,vj)(vi,vj) in EE, if the edge (vi,vj)(vi,vj) has unordered endpoints, then it is an undirected edge, and the graph GG is then called an undirected graph. An undirected graph is the simplest graph model, and the following figure shows the same undirected graph, with vertices represented using circles and edges as lines between vertices, without arrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/06/93c176f0dcae42c3945ab112b3e8852f.png&#34; alt=&#34;undirected graphs&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;api-for-undirected-graphs&#34;&gt;API for undirected graphs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an undirected graph, we care about the number of vertices of the graph, the number of edges, the adjacent vertices of each vertex and the add operation of the edges, so the interface is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation-of-undirected-graph&#34;&gt;Implementation of undirected graph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adjacency-matrix&#34;&gt;Adjacency matrix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representing graphs with matrices is often convenient for studying the properties and applications of graphs. There are various matrix representations for various graphs, such as the power matrix and the adjacency matrix, and here we are only concerned with the adjacency matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use a two-dimensional Boolean array &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; to implement the adjacency matrix when &lt;code&gt;A[i][j] = true&lt;/code&gt; indicating that vertices &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; are adjacent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a graph GG with nn vertices, the adjacency matrix consumes a space of size n2n2 boolean values, which is very wasteful for sparse graphs and can be astronomical when the number of vertices is large. Also, when the graph is special, with self-loops and parallel edges, the adjacency matrix representation is powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;arrays-of-edges&#34;&gt;Arrays of edges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For undirected graphs, we can implement a class &lt;code&gt;Edge&lt;/code&gt; with only two instance variables to store the two vertices uu and vv, and then just keep all &lt;code&gt;Edges&lt;/code&gt; inside an array. This has a big problem, that is, when getting all adjacent vertices of vertex vv, you have to traverse the whole array to get them, the time complexity is O(|E|)O(|E|), and since getting adjacent vertices is a very common operation, this representation is not very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adjacency-table-arrays&#34;&gt;Adjacency table arrays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we represent a vertex as an integer taking values in the range 0∼|V|-10∼|V|-1, then we can represent each vertex by the index of an array of length |V||V|, and then set each array element as a chain table with the other vertices adjacent to the vertex represented by the index mounted on it. The undirected graph shown above can be represented by the array of adjacency tables shown in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/07/4aa2dba7444b4eaab69c62b0b84ea9cf.png&#34; alt=&#34;Adjacent Table Array&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to implement an undirected graph using adjacency tables is shown below. Since each link in the adjacency table array holds the vertices adjacent to the vertices, adding edges to the graph requires adding nodes to both links in the array as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;traversal-of-undirected-graphs&#34;&gt;Traversal of undirected graphs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the following graph, how do I find the path from each vertex to vertex 0? Or simply, given vertices 0 and 4, how do you determine if you can reach vertex 4 if you start at vertex 0? This requires two types of graph traversal: depth-first search and breadth-first search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before presenting these two traversal methods, the API that needs to be implemented to solve the above problem is given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;depth-first-search&#34;&gt;Depth-first search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of depth-first search is similar to the prior-order traversal of a tree. We start at vertex 0 and add its neighboring vertices 2, 1, and 5 to the stack. Then pop the vertex 2 at the top of the stack and add its adjacent vertices 0, 1, 3, 4 to the stack, but writing this you will find a problem: vertices 0 and 1 are already on the stack, if you add them to the stack, then the stack will never become empty. So we need to maintain an array &lt;code&gt;boolean[] marked&lt;/code&gt;, and when we add a vertex &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to the stack, we set &lt;code&gt;marked[i]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, so that the next time we want to add a vertex &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to the stack, we have to check if &lt;code&gt;marked[i]&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, and if it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to add it again. to the stack. Repeating the popping of the node at the top of the stack and the stacking of the nodes adjacent to the node until the stack is empty, we finish traversing all the vertices reachable by vertex 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep track of the path from each vertex to vertex 0, we also need an array &lt;code&gt;int[] edgeTo&lt;/code&gt;. Whenever we visit vertex &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and press one of its neighboring vertices &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; onto the stack, we set &lt;code&gt;edgeTo[i]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, which means that to get from vertex &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; to vertex 0, we need to backtrack to vertex &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt; and then get the next vertex to backtrack to from vertex &lt;code&gt;edgeTo[u]&lt;/code&gt; until we find vertex 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;breadth-first-search&#34;&gt;Breadth-first search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of breadth-first search is similar to a hierarchical traversal of a tree. Unlike depth-first search, which starts from vertex 0, breadth-first search processes all vertices 2, 1, and 5 adjacent to vertex 0 before proceeding to the vertices adjacent to vertex 2, 1, and 5. This search process is the process of expanding further and further out in a circle, so it can be used to get the shortest path from vertex 0 to other nodes. Breadth-first search can be achieved by simply replacing the heap in depth-first search with a queue: the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9

      <title>Usage of Bigdecimal</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;code&gt;Java&lt;/code&gt; developer in the daily work, many times we will encounter some need to calculate the data scenario, usually for the scenario does not need to calculate the precision we can use &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; to calculate, although will lose precision but occasionally can be used, if we need to calculate the results accurately, we will use the class BigDecimal provided in the java.math package to implement the corresponding function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; is a tool for accurate data calculation, since it is a data calculation, it will definitely provide the corresponding methods of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division for us to use, as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;add(BigDecimal)&lt;/code&gt; : Add the values in the &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object and return the &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;subtract(BigDecimal)&lt;/code&gt; : The values in &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object are subtracted, and &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object is returned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;multiply(BigDecimal)&lt;/code&gt; : Multiply the values in the &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object and return the &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;divide(BigDecimal)&lt;/code&gt; : Divide the values in the &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object, and return the &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we need to use the corresponding method, we need to create &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object first, and then we can use it, and the corresponding constructor methods are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BigDecimal(int)&lt;/code&gt; : Create an object with the integer value specified by the parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BigDecimal(double)&lt;/code&gt; : Creates an object with the double precision value specified by the parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BigDecimal(long)&lt;/code&gt; : Creates an object with the long integer value specified by the parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BigDecimal(String)&lt;/code&gt; : Creates an object with the value specified by the parameter as a string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; object is created by the constructor method, the corresponding method is called and another &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; parameter is passed to achieve the corresponding addition, subtraction, multiplication and division method. The following example is shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;22
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;23
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;24
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;25
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;org.test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above figure, we can see that BigDecimal is used in a specific way by calling the corresponding method and passing in the corresponding parameters. However, when dividing, we can see that the divide method also provides the parameter to set the exact number of digits, and it is possible to set the specific rounding method. There are several integer methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because num2 is larger than num1, the return value is 1; when num2 is equal to num1, it returns 0; when num2 is smaller than num1, it returns -1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summary format is as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bigdemical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;compareTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;bigdemical2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//a = -1, means bigdemical is smaller than bigdemical2.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//a = 0,means bigdemical is equal to bigdemical2.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;//a = 1,means bigdemical is greater than bigdemical2.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (num2.compareTo(num1) &amp;gt; 0)&lt;/code&gt; judgment is a common operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also BigDecimal provides methods to convert directly to int, long, float, double numeric values as follows, and it is used relatively rarely in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;v1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;doubleValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;short&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shortValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;num1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;byteValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; when you need accurate decimal calculation in your daily work, the performance of &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; is relatively worse than &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, so use it only when you need it. &lt;code&gt;BigDecimal&lt;/code&gt; creates a new object every time we add, subtract, multiply and divide, and we need to save it when we need to use it later, so usually we try to use the constructor of String type.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java8 new features of the time and date API</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java8-time-api/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 17:40:16 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java8-time-api/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Java8 includes a new time and date API, which is placed under the &lt;code&gt;java.time&lt;/code&gt; package. This new time-date API is &lt;strong&gt;immutable and thread-safe&lt;/strong&gt; (This class is immutable and thread-safe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;local-time-localdate-localtime-localdatetime&#34;&gt;Local time: LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instances of the classes &lt;code&gt;localDate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LocalTime&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;LocalDateTime&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;immutable objects&lt;/strong&gt; that represent the date, time, date, and time, respectively, using the ISO-8601 calendar system. They provide a simple date or time and do not contain current time information. Nor do they contain information related to the time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;localDate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LocalTime&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;LocalDateTime&lt;/code&gt; are used in exactly the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take &lt;code&gt;localDateTime&lt;/code&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// Get the current date and time
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;LocalDateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nowDateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;LocalDateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;nowDateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// Get the specified date and time
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;LocalDateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;assignDateTime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;LocalDateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;2017&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;55&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;assignDateTime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>How to estimate throughput and thread pool size</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/threadpool-size/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 17:35:33 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/threadpool-size/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;estimating-throughput&#34;&gt;Estimating Throughput&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is a task which execution time is divided into 2 parts, the first part does math and the second part waits for IO. these two parts are called compute operation and wait operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we need to estimate the peak throughput that can be achieved by executing this task with the CPU at full power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we need to know how much time it takes to execute this task, how much time is spent on the computation part and how much time is spent on the wait part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the computation part of the task takes 1 second and the waiting part takes 9 seconds, and that 10 threads are opened to execute 10 tasks, the following execution graph can be obtained with a single-core CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/04/62bb8721a00048e691e52cb9275cb3a8.png&#34; alt=&#34;task image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue line in the graph is the waiting schedule, the orange line is the execution of the computation task, and the green line is the time spent by the CPU waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can benefit from having 10 threads open, each task can use the waiting time of other tasks to perform its own computational operations, while keeping the CPU always busy, i.e. 100% utilization. This also tells you that even if you open 11 threads, you won&amp;rsquo;t get more benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, the OS will run these 10 threads alternately, see the red line in the diagram, and the OS can schedule the computation tasks of these 10 tasks as many times as it wants within this range. If the overhead of thread scheduling is removed, the total time spent is still equal to 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The throughput of this diagram becomes obvious: ``The throughput of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;throughput = 10 tasks / (10 * computing time + wait time) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;           = 10 tasks / (10 * 1s + 9s) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;           = 10 / 19s = 0.526 tasks/s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we now have a dual-core CPU?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/04/a84521f5605444d39f435e47870e93ae.png&#34; alt=&#34;one core&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that because there are 2 CPU cores, the computational tasks can overlap and thus the time spent is halved and the throughput is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;throughput = 10 tasks / (10 * computing time / 2 + wait time) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;           = 10 tasks / (10 * 1s / 2 + 9s) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;           = 10 / 14s = 0.7142 tasks/s
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to summarize the throughput calculation formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughput: throughput.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tn: number of tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C: Number of CPUs. Can have a decimal number, such as 0.5, which means only half of the computing power is provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tc: time spent by task computation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tw: the time spent by task waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E: time consumed for the last task to finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/04/047c14c5f5e74c579162aa2d5285fb6a.png&#34; alt=&#34;two cores&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C=1 in the formula means that the CPU is working at 100% of full speed, if C=0.5 then it means that the CPU has 50% of idle time, if C=2 then it means that two CPUs are started to run at full speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that to increase the throughput there are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase C, which will be discussed below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrease Tc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrease Tw&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea is to use more CPU cores to make the task run in less time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you think you can also improve throughput by increasing Tn, as in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/04/ec47fc65e45b49ff8887a68d47d28d41.png&#34; alt=&#34;task-number-throughput&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the throughput goes up with the number of tasks, so will it always be longer? The answer is no, as Tn gets bigger and bigger, Tn * Tc / C will also get bigger and bigger, then you can ignore Tw and the formula becomes C / Tc, which is the theoretical upper bound on throughput, and increasing Tn will only converge to this value infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;estimating-thread-pool-size&#34;&gt;Estimating thread pool size&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question is, how do you know how many threads to open to get the CPU to reach the target utilization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depends on the following equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;N: Number of CPUs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U: CPU utilization, 0.1 means 10%, 1 means 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C: time used CPU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W: Waiting time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/04/b199770ae06345e2ac65334068f7fbec.png&#34; alt=&#34;number of threads&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: N * U in this formula = C in the throughput formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If U = 1 (100% utilization), it is the ratio of W to C that determines the number of threads, when W is higher then more threads are needed, when W = 0, only the same number of threads as N is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formula also tells us that opening more threads will not bring additional benefits but will cause the opposite effect (increased thread scheduling overhead), so in practice we use thread pools with upper bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when actually doing performance tuning, the thread pool size is adjusted around the calculated number to achieve the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changes to the String object in Java 9</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java9-string/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 17:27:47 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java9-string/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java 9, the underlying String object has been changed from &lt;code&gt;char[]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt;, which has the immediate benefit of being more memory-efficient, hence the name Compact Strings Improvement. Because in Java &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; takes up 2 bytes and &lt;code&gt;byte&lt;/code&gt; takes up 1 byte, while a Unicode character does not necessarily need 2 bytes to be represented, at least ASCII characters only need 1 byte to be done. That is, if your string is full of ASCII characters, half the space would be wasted if you use char.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-brief-unicode-description&#34;&gt;A brief Unicode description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Unicode and its Code Points and Code Units, think of Unicode as a giant table where each character has a unique corresponding number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Code Point represents the serial number of a Unicode character in the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#39;A&amp;#39;.codePointAt(0).toString(16)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;41&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#39;π&amp;#39;.codePointAt(0).toString(16)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;3c0&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#39;🙂&amp;#39;.codePointAt(0).toString(16)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;1f642&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One or more Code Units represent a Code Point, which is used to store and transmit Unicode characters, as follows in UTF-8 encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Character&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Code point&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Code units&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0x0041&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;01000001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;π&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0x03C0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11001111, 10000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;i&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0x1F642&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11110000, 10011111, 10011001, 10000010&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UTF-8 Code Unit occupies 8 bits (1 byte), UTF-16 Code Unit occupies 16 bits (2 bytes), UTF-32 Code Unit occupies 32 bits (4 bytes), except for UTF-32, UTF-8/16 are variable length encoding, which means that when converting a Code Point into a Code Unit This means that when converting a Code Point to a Code Unit, one or more Code Units are used depending on the situation (as explained in the table above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when Java 9 String is changed from &lt;code&gt;char[]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;byte[]&lt;/code&gt; at the bottom, unless UTF-32 encoding (fixed-length encoding) is used, then it is definitely variable-length encoding, making the memory footprint more compact. That&amp;rsquo;s why the Java 9 String API adds methods on Code Point.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java generates a lot of zombie process problems</title>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-zombie-processes/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I encountered a problem, a Java process using Runtime().exec() to execute script files, creating a large number of zombie processes, while the Java process is running in the container.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that time, I saw this situation on the Host machine, and I could see that there were a large number of zombie processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/04/39c536ee2c2f49fbaae10dd52ed67ddf.png&#34; alt=&#34;java process&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading the code then reveals that the Java program executes the shell script in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Process &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Runtime.getRuntime&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;.exec&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;new String&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Process &lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Runtime.getRuntime&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;.exec&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;new String&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;sh&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;-c&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking Zombie process appears on child processes: when a child process finishes execution, but its parent does not read its exit status via the wait system call, it is not cleared in the process table, so it becomes a zombie process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Process objects in the code are destroyedForcibly().waitFor() in finally, which means that it ends normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, by elimination, we found that the problem lies in this execution of sh -c &lt;cmd&gt;, and a minimally reproducible version of DockerZombie.java is provided here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;printStackTrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;destroyForcibly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;waitFor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;stdout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above code provides 4 ways to execute scripts, and the following table shows the corresponding docker commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;script execution method&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;docker command&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;sh -c &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm docker-zombie:latest sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/bin/sh -c &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm docker-zombie:lest /bin/sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;/bin/bash -c &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm docker-zombie:lest /bin/bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --rm docker-zombie:lest foo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the base image is using &lt;code&gt;openjdk:8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;openjdk:8-slim&lt;/code&gt; then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the first two definitely generate zombie processes and the number spikes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last two will also be generated, but in small numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corresponding to &lt;code&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;FROM openjdk:8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;RUN mkdir /java-app
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WORKDIR /java-app
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;COPY DockerZombie.java .
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;RUN javac DockerZombie.java
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ENTRYPOINT &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;java&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;DockerZombie&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the base image is using openjdk:8-alpine then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then all will generate zombie processes, but the number is small and stable at about 10
Corresponding Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;FROM openjdk:8-alpine
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;RUN apk add bash
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;RUN mkdir /java-app
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WORKDIR /java-app
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;COPY DockerZombie.java .
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;RUN javac DockerZombie.java
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;ENTRYPOINT &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;java&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;DockerZombie&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to cure this problem, we will provide solutions in subsequent articles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Linux 5.18 has two key improvements to exFAT file system support</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/linux-exfat/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/linux-exfat/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the foreign media &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Linux-5.18-exFAT&#34;&gt;Phoronix presentation&lt;/a&gt;: This week&amp;rsquo;s Linux 5.18 merge window has two driver PRs for the Microsoft exFAT file system, both of which are very important driver patches, albeit small in number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;exFAT on Linux 5.18+ adds an option to allow access to paths with trailing points. Until now, the exFAT driver unconditionally removed trailing dots from path components, while Linux 5.18 introduced the exFAT &amp;ldquo;keep_last_dots&amp;rdquo; mount option, which can be used to control whether trailing dots are removed. The motivation for this work was the discovery that the FUSE exFAT driver&amp;rsquo;s trailing dots worked well, but the Linux kernel driver did not allow it. For more information about this &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linkinjeon/exfat.git/commit/?h=dev&amp;amp;id=9ec784bf774c2d3b35a7577fc6441cfbd60aefea&#34;&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt; can be viewed in the Linux kernel mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/03/788a4b1c8f56490fba37fb5bc262b451.png&#34; alt=&#34;exfat&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux 5.18 &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linkinjeon/exfat.git/commit/?h=dev&amp;amp;id=a4a3d8c52d952ab1f5c8b8b67b57f2e01936628d&#34;&gt;another exFAT patch&lt;/a&gt; is to: no longer clear VolumeDirty in writebacks and avoid shortening storage device life. Prior to this patch, if &amp;lsquo;dirsync&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;sync&amp;rsquo; was not enabled, VolumeDirty was cleared first in the writeback. However, if a sudden power failure occurs after purging VolumeDirty and no other updates are written, the exFAT file system will not detect the power failure on the next mount. And VolumeDirty will be reset when the parent directory is updated, but not cleared. This means that the BootSector must be written to at least once per write back, which shortens the life of the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/4/1/403&#34;&gt;exFAT pull&lt;/a&gt; in Linux 5.18.&lt;/p&gt;

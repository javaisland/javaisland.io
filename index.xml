      <title>Cloud Native Compiler - Java Cloud Compiler</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-cloud-compiler/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 20:45:51 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-cloud-compiler/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Azul has introduced a new cloud-native compiler, Java Cloud Compiler, which offloads Java JIT compilation from local systems to elastic resources, reducing the amount of resources needed to run applications and shortening the time to peak performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;understanding-jit-and-aot&#34;&gt;Understanding JIT and AOT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Java Runtime is a completely self-reliant system designed to run and improve code on a single system. The runtime works through just-in-time (JIT) compilation, using native resources that convert Java bytecode (JAR and class files) into native code to improve speed and memory. Simon Ritter, Azul&amp;rsquo;s Deputy CTO, explains this process understanding Java compilation in a blog post detailing how code improves over time. JIT compilation is transparent to most users transparently, requiring no developer or administrator interaction, but curious developers can monitor their role JITWatch with the following tools.By offloading this JIT compilation to a separate system, Azul&amp;rsquo;s cloud compiler can execute the JIT faster, share optimizations between systems running the same code, and return resources to the application to improve throughput or reduce the total CPU/RAM required and reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat has published a blog, How the JIT Compiler Improves Performance in the OpenJDK, which covers how JIT improves Java applications as they run. This post discusses how Java applications start, monitor code, and perform optimizations to improve performance in part. These JIT optimizations are done in a self-reliant JRE that shares resources with the running application and seeks to make improvements in the application as it runs, then switches the execution to faster JIT code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative to JIT is advance (AOT) compilation, which seeks to compile Java applications directly into native code rather than through bytecode. AOT aims to reduce the time to peak performance and improve memory consumption by working ahead. A Belton article that delves into the new Java JIT compiler describes the role and differences between the standard OpenJDK JIT compiler C1/C2 and the GraalVM AOT compiler. neither JIT nor AOT is inherently better-although AOT can often be started faster, the &amp;ldquo;ahead of time &amp;quot; term ignores what can be learned from observing what parts of the code run, as well as the fact that AOT compilation takes significantly longer rather than bytecode, and includes other behavioral tradeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-compiler&#34;&gt;Cloud Compiler&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azul Smart Cloud introduces a third option that connects the benefits of JIT (peak performance) with the benefits of AOT (fast startup time). Since teams typically run the same code across many systems, the JRE communicates with the organization&amp;rsquo;s shared JIT server, so each JRE does not need to perform the same watch and optimization cycles. The cloud compiler can then also perform deeper analysis using CPU resources that are isolated from the running application. The resulting application can achieve peak performance in the network time required to transfer this information and run with the improved code. In the tests described by QCon, peak performance was reached in a much faster time and throughput was 25% to 100% faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azul&amp;rsquo;s Cloud Compiler is available in the commercial Azul Prime distribution. The free version of Prime is available for development, testing and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java Virtual Threads</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-virtual-thread/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Jun 2022 19:20:24 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-virtual-thread/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Virtual threading is something I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about. It&amp;rsquo;s a long-awaited feature in the language and we&amp;rsquo;ve made very few attempts to implement it in the past, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally here and it&amp;rsquo;s been merged into Java 19. This means that it will be included as a preview feature and we will be able to use it as soon as JDK 19 is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the content on the virtual (green) threads is written by non-Java developers, why is that? Green threads are new to the Java world, most Java applications use regular (platform) threads and have little exposure to the concept. java is one of the most popular languages and is the only one of them that does not support any form of async/await without the help of third party libraries (which we will cover soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early versions of Java, when designing the multithreading API, Sun Microsystems was faced with a dilemma: should we use user-mode threads or map Java threads one-to-one with OS threads. All benchmarks at the time showed that user-mode threads were severely underutilized, increasing memory consumption without giving much in return. However, this is a benchmark from 20 years ago, when things were completely different. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have such high load requirements, and the Java language wasn&amp;rsquo;t very mature. Things are different now, and we have made little attempt to introduce user-mode threads into the language. Take fibers, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, because they were implemented as a separate class, it was difficult to migrate the entire code base to it, and eventually they disappeared and were never merged into the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-loom&#34;&gt;Project Loom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/06/13/8c9ca05b99434e4b934c54f44d4c9ca0.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several Java projects that require very specific tasks to be completed. Examples include Valhala, Panama, Amber, and of course Loom. Loom&amp;rsquo;s goal is to overhaul the language&amp;rsquo;s concurrency model. Their goal is to bring virtual threads, structured concurrency, and a few other smaller things (for now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-few-words-about-the-java-concurrency-model&#34;&gt;A few words about the Java concurrency model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way threads are implemented in the JVM is considered to be one of the best ways, even for non-Java developers. We have excellent thread debugging, and you can get thread dumps, breakpoints, memory checks, and more. You can even use the JFR API to define custom metrics for your threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Thread class is Java&amp;rsquo;s way of giving you access to the OS Thread API. Most of the operations performed in this class make system calls. In production we rarely use threads directly, we use the Java Concurrency package and thread pools, locks and other goodies.Java has excellent built-in tools for multi-threading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;concurrency-and-parallelism&#34;&gt;Concurrency and &lt;strong&gt;parallelism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/06/13/ef415101862d42a38202d4d2f3d9edeb.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we move on to the fun stuff, we have to address this issue. Concurrency and parallelism are two things that are often confused and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;parallelism&lt;/strong&gt; means &lt;strong&gt;executing two or more tasks at the same time&lt;/strong&gt; . This is only possible if the CPU supports it. We need multiple cores to achieve parallelism. However, modern CPUs are always multi-core, and single-core CPUs are mostly obsolete and no longer widely used because their performance is significantly better than multi-core CPUs. this is because modern applications are designed to take advantage of multiple cores, and they always need to do something at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrency means simultaneously &lt;strong&gt;managing tasks&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, JavaScript is a single-threaded language, and everything that must happen at the same time happens at the same time. A single thread manages all the tasks generated by the code. JS uses async/await to do this, and we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss other ways to implement concurrency later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an operating system perspective, the CPU must handle multiple threads of processes. The number of threads is always higher than the number of cores, which means that the CPU must perform &lt;strong&gt;context switching&lt;/strong&gt;. Briefly each thread has a priority and can be idle, working or waiting for a CPU cycle. the CPU must iterate through all non-idle threads and allocate its limited resources according to the priority. In addition, it must ensure that all threads with the same priority get the same amount of CPU time, otherwise some applications may freeze. Each time the kernel is assigned to a different thread, it must freeze the currently running thread and preserve its register state. In addition to this, it must keep track of whether there are idle threads that have not been woken up. As you can see, this is a rather complex and expensive operation and we as developers should try to minimize the number of threads we use. Ideally, the number of threads should be close to the number of CPU cores, so that we can minimize CPU context switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-java-server-concurrency-issues&#34;&gt;Modern Java Server Concurrency Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud space is getting bigger and bigger, and with it comes load and resource requirements. Most enterprise servers (the most heavily loaded servers) are written in Java, so Java is used to solve the load problem. So far it has done a good job, judging by the fact that it is still the most popular server language, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual way we handle requests is to dedicate a platform thread to them, which is the &amp;ldquo;thread per request model&amp;rdquo;. When a client requests something and we get the data or process it, that thread is occupied and cannot be used by anyone else. The server starts and allocates a predefined number of threads (e.g. 200 for Tomcat). They are placed in the thread pool and wait for requests. Their initial state is called &amp;ldquo;Parked&amp;rdquo; and in this state they do not use CPU resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easy to write, understand and debug, but what if the client requests something that executes a blocking call? A blocking call is an operation that waits for a third-party call to complete, such as a SQL query, a request for a different service, or a simple IO operation to the operating system. When a blocking call occurs, the &lt;strong&gt;thread must wait&lt;/strong&gt; . While it is waiting, the thread is not available and the CPU must manage it because it is not idle. This increases context switching. The server limits the number of threads, a higher number of threads may increase the throughput, but they slow down the request processing considerably. This is a good balance that we must keep in mind and manage. People often ask, &amp;ldquo;why not just spawn 10k threads and process 10k requests at the same time&amp;rdquo;, and while this may not stop the operating system from stopping you, gee, you can even spawn a million threads with the right configuration, there are benchmarks that show 80% of CPU utilization is purely for 3-4k threads on popular CPUs. 4k threads after context switching, and remembering that the OS also needs the CPU to run and manage other processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address our scalability issues, we typically just scale and spawn multiple nodes of the server. This is feasible, and we can now handle any number of requests if we pay enough to the cloud provider, but one of the main drivers for using cloud technology is to reduce operational costs. Sometimes we can&amp;rsquo;t afford the extra expense and end up with a slow and nearly unusable system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;concurrency-model&#34;&gt;Concurrency Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;callbacks&#34;&gt;Callbacks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callbacks are a simple but powerful concept. They are objects that are passed as arguments to other functions or procedures. The parent function passes the callback to the child function, which can then use the callback to notify the parent of some event, such as &amp;ldquo;I have completed my task&amp;rdquo;. This is a way to achieve concurrency on a single thread. Callbacks form a stack trace, which can make debugging easier. They are good when the nesting is one or two layers, but quickly get out of hand when you need to build more complex callback chains. Currently, they are mainly used as building blocks for other concurrency models and are considered a bad practice and legacy issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;asynchronouswaiting-and-commitment&#34;&gt;Asynchronous/waiting and commitment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, this model is based on promises. promise represents the final computation (or failure). A function can return a Promise, such as the result of an http request, and then the calling function can link their logic to it. This is how concurrency is implemented in most popular languages.Java also has Promise, but they are called &lt;strong&gt;Futures&lt;/strong&gt;, but only &lt;strong&gt;CompletableFuture&lt;/strong&gt; has the full list of functions for Promise.Most operations in Java are blocking, and Futures will take up threads anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Async/await is the syntactic sugar of Promises&lt;/strong&gt;. It saves you from writing cumbersome sample files for linking, subscribing, and managing Promise. You can usually mark a function as &lt;em&gt;async&lt;/em&gt; and its result is wrapped internally in a Promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big problems you can run into with async/await is the infamous colored function problem. Using async on a function essentially makes it non-blocking, but blocking functions (without the async prefix) can&amp;rsquo;t call them unless they use await. you might ask, &amp;ldquo;So what? I just make everything asynchronous and never use blocking functions&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; Sure, but you need a third-party library to block and boom everything goes to hell. Also, there may be some things in the language that are inherently blocking, and sooner or later you will be forced to deal with function colors. It is important to note that in some languages like C# this is not the case and your async/await has no function colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;concurrency-continued--routines&#34;&gt;Concurrency (continued + routines)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we talk about concurrent processes, we don&amp;rsquo;t mean Kotlin&amp;rsquo;s concurrent processes, they just steal the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;continuity&lt;/strong&gt; is a special kind of function call. If function A calls function B and it&amp;rsquo;s the last thing A does, then we can say that B is a continuation of A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;routines&lt;/strong&gt; (aka. subroutines) are reusable pieces of code that are usually called multiple times during execution. Think of them as a set of immutable instructions with inputs and outputs that you can call at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining these terms, we get CoRoutines&lt;/strong&gt; . They are essentially suspendable tasks managed by the runtime, and they form a tree structure of chained calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoRoutines have several key properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can be suspended &lt;strong&gt;and resumed&lt;/strong&gt; at any time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are a data structure that &lt;strong&gt;remembers its state and stack trace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can &lt;strong&gt;cede/give control to other concurrent programs&lt;/strong&gt; (subroutines)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They must have isDone(), yield(), and run() functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a concurrent process in JS, sorry to all hardcore Java readers :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has a yield mechanism. With it, you can create so-called generators. To support this, they have pretty much implemented concurrency in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;function *getNumbersGen() {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  console.log(&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  yield 1;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  console.log(&amp;#34;2&amp;#34;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  yield 2;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  console.log(&amp;#34;3&amp;#34;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  yield 3;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  console.log(&amp;#34;Temp &amp;#34; + temp);

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is our simple generator.&amp;rsquo; *&amp;rsquo; marks the function as a generator, and then the function can use yield. this &lt;code&gt;yield&lt;/code&gt; keyword is used to pause and resume the generator function (same as hang/run).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we execute the following code, it will get the numbers from the generator until it stops generating them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;1&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Num 1&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;2&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Num 2&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;3&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Num 3&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Temp 5&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how the control is generated between the two code blocks, first the generator prints the number and then loops through it. In addition, we define the temp variable at the beginning of the generator, after which the value of temp is generated back and forth and still retained and printed correctly.This generator implements everything needed to be called a concurrent program. It can pause, it can resume and it can maintain its state. All of this is handled by the JS interpreter. Great, we implemented concurrency without introducing any special words like async and await,we don&amp;rsquo;t have colored functions, but still run on a single Thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtual-threads&#34;&gt;Virtual threads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loom&amp;rsquo;s developers had a lot to think about and multiple ways to implement virtual threads. I&amp;rsquo;m glad they chose the concurrent thread approach. The &lt;strong&gt;Thread class will remain the same and use the same API&lt;/strong&gt; . This makes the migration seamless and the switch to green threads is just a sign. However, this comes at a huge cost. They have to go through every API of the language, such as Sockets and I/O, and make it non-blocking in case it runs in a virtual thread. This is a huge change that affects the core JDK APIs. In addition, it had to be backwards compatible and not break existing logic. No wonder this took more than 5 years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to switch to virtual threads, we don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn something new, we just need to forget something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never merge virtual threads&lt;/strong&gt; , they are cheap and pointless&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop using thread local variables&lt;/strong&gt; . They will work, but if you spawn millions of threads, you&amp;rsquo;ll run into memory problems. According to Ron Pressler: &amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Thread-local variables should not be exposed to end users and should be kept as internal implementation details&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ldquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An almost exhaustive list of advantages of virtual threads over platform threads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context switching actually becomes free&lt;/strong&gt; . They are managed by the JVM, which means that the JVM will perform context switching between threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tail/call optimization.&lt;/strong&gt; They mention in the JEP that tail-call optimization is done on threads. This can save a lot of memory for the stack, but it is still a work in progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheap start/stop.&lt;/strong&gt; When we stop the OS thread, we have to make a system call to terminate the thread and then release the memory it is occupying. When starting the OS thread, we make the system call again. Starting and killing a green thread is just a matter of deleting the object and then letting the GC delete it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard cap.&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned before, the OS can handle so many threads. Even with hardware improvements, we still can&amp;rsquo;t keep up with demand. Currently you can spawn tens of millions of virtual threads (which should be enough for most cases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threads that perform transactions behave very differently than threads that perform video processing.&lt;/strong&gt; This is very easy to overlook. Essentially what I&amp;rsquo;m saying is that the OS and CPU must be optimized for the general case. They must be able to handle the various tasks requested by the application, so they cannot be optimized for specific use cases. the JVM can optimize its threads for the specific task of processing the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resizable stacks.&lt;/strong&gt; Virtual threads exist in RAM. Their stacks and metadata are there as well. Platform threads must be allocated a fixed stack size (1MB for Java) and that stack cannot be resized. This means that if you exceed it you get stackoverflow, and if you don&amp;rsquo;t use it you waste memory. In addition, the minimum memory required to bootstrap a virtual thread is about 200-300 bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-virtual-threads&#34;&gt;Using Virtual Threads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1_000_000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;printStackTrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we try to create 1 million regular threads, and all the threads do is sleep for 1 second and then die. Obviously, this code throws an OutOfMemory error, and on my machine I was able to generate 40k threads before I ran out of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s try to generate virtual ones. In order to create a new virtual thread, we have to use &lt;em&gt;Thread.startVirtualThread(runnable).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1_000_000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;startVirtualThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;printStackTrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code worked fine and I was able to generate over 20 million of these threads on my machine. This is to be expected, since a user mode thread is nothing more than an object in the memory managed by the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s dig a little deeper. Usually when we use threads, we use them together with thread pools. We will define a blocking code that needs to be executed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;someWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;taskName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;currentThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34; executing &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;taskName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;https://httpstat.us/200?sleep=2000&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getContent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;currentThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34; completed &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;taskName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;printStackTrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We print the platform (operator) thread where the code is running, then make a 2 second http call, then print the operator thread again. Simple enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s run it in parallel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newFixedThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;taskName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Task&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;someWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;taskName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We create a fixed size thread pool with 5 threads and submit 10 tasks that will only run the &lt;em&gt;someWork&lt;/em&gt; method described earlier. Did you notice anything else? The thread pool is in the try-with-resources block! This is a new Java 19 feature that now tries to use resources to wait for all threads to complete, and we no longer need to use &lt;em&gt;shutdown&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;awaitTermination when using thread pooling.&lt;/em&gt; Anyway, the above code provides us with the following output&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#25,pool-1-thread-5,5,main] executing Task5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#24,pool-1-thread-4,5,main] executing Task4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#21,pool-1-thread-1,5,main] executing Task1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#22,pool-1-thread-2,5,main] executing Task2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#23,pool-1-thread-3,5,main] executing Task3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#21,pool-1-thread-1,5,main] completed Task1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#22,pool-1-thread-2,5,main] completed Task2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#21,pool-1-thread-1,5,main] executing Task6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#22,pool-1-thread-2,5,main] executing Task7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#25,pool-1-thread-5,5,main] completed Task5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#23,pool-1-thread-3,5,main] completed Task3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#24,pool-1-thread-4,5,main] completed Task4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#25,pool-1-thread-5,5,main] executing Task8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#23,pool-1-thread-3,5,main] executing Task9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#24,pool-1-thread-4,5,main] executing Task10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#22,pool-1-thread-2,5,main] completed Task7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#21,pool-1-thread-1,5,main] completed Task6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#25,pool-1-thread-5,5,main] completed Task8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#24,pool-1-thread-4,5,main] completed Task10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Thread[#23,pool-1-thread-3,5,main] completed Task9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note how each task is executed by the same thread. (e.g. &lt;em&gt;Task4&lt;/em&gt; was completed by &lt;em&gt;Thread[#24,pool-1-thread-4,5,main]&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shows that when the blocking call is made, the thread is waiting and resumes after 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s convert it to a user mode thread. The code is the same, we just need to use &lt;em&gt;Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()&lt;/em&gt; to create a new green thread each time a task is submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;taskName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Task&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;someWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;taskName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time we get the following output&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice how the task is now executed by two threads, the first executing the code before the blocking call and the second after. For example &lt;em&gt;Task5&lt;/em&gt; is executed first by &lt;em&gt;ForkJoinPool-1-worker-5&lt;/em&gt; and then by &lt;em&gt;ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1.&lt;/em&gt; This shows that we are not blocking the operator threads. Note also that we are now using a forked connection pool. This pool has a certain size number of cores and is managed by the JVM. It is also used for things like parallel streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very similar to the JavaScript example we gave earlier. Threads give up control to each other, state is retained and then restored, a true collaborative process. The best part is that it&amp;rsquo;s the same as regular blocking code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;server-sending-events&#34;&gt;Server sending events&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use this as a cool use case for user mode threads. If you are not familiar with SSE, this is a good and more detailed explanation. Essentially, we open an http connection and never close it, and then the server is able to keep pushing data to the client. It&amp;rsquo;s very lightweight and much cheaper than WebSockets. The problem is that in order to implement it, we need a thread to keep running and sending events to the stream, and if the thread dies, we will disconnect. You can already see that using platform threads here is not a good idea. Using virtual threads, we can do this in spring boot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SseEmitter is a special class in Spring MVC that implements the SSE protocol. What we do is create an infinite loop (obviously not production code) and send new data to the client every 500 milliseconds. Then any number of clients can subscribe to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-not-to-use-virtual-threads&#34;&gt;When not to use virtual threads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having to manage virtual threads can degrade performance. For less loaded applications, threads may be preferable to virtual threads simply because context switching is lower when there are few active clients. In addition, if your application is CPU-intensive, such as performing a lot of math calculations, it does not make sense to use green threads, since they must occupy OS threads during calculations anyway. In general, Loom will not make your application faster, it will only increase its throughput, so if throughput is not an issue, then stick with platform threads. This blog does a good job of analyzing and showing how Loom utilizes threads, but if you read it, keep in mind that the author bashes Loom for things it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing in the first place (like fair thread scheduling).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find your bottleneck&lt;/strong&gt; . Whether you use Postgres with 50 connection pools and then spawn more than 50 threads (platform or non-platform) won&amp;rsquo;t make any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reference, you can check out little&amp;rsquo;s law and this great article on the topic of choosing the optimal number of threads&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;structured-concurrency&#34;&gt;Structured Concurrency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured concurrency refers to the way we handle the life cycle of threads. Currently we can&amp;rsquo;t stop a thread that no longer needs to run, because their results are obsolete. We can only send an &lt;strong&gt;interrupt signal that will eventually be consumed and the thread stopped&lt;/strong&gt;. This wastes RAM and CPU cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;all-tasks-must-succeed-if-one-fails-there-is-no-point-in-continuing&#34;&gt;All tasks must succeed, if one fails, there is no point in continuing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/06/13/2e3437cc2daf4708a74b4d73d81b9a81.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve marked in red the threads that need to be stopped immediately after reaching a certain state. With Loom we can do this, currently we have no choice but to stop the thread manually except for the special thread pool they will introduce, but this JEP promises to bring more utilities to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These may seem like small optimizations, in fact they are trivial for small applications or low load servers. When you are dealing with millions of requests per day, these things really matter, in fact they can be game changers and in some cases greatly increase your throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-you-are-using-a-reactor-framework-should-you-consider-switching-to-loom&#34;&gt;If you are using a reactor framework, should you consider switching to Loom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/06/13/7eae4130ab8543be876d839a01cd59fc.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reactor framework is very good at dealing with application throughput issues. What they do is essentially create abstract tasks (similar to a concurrent process) and wrap everything in them. The reactor runtime then manages these tasks. Sounds very similar to virtual threading, but with few major problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t support it, which leads to very complex code (Flux/Mono)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The excellent Java thread debugging we talked about before is completely ignored and replaced by a centralized error handler that provides almost zero information. We must rely heavily on logging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you use the reactor style it&amp;rsquo;s hard to go back and you may have to rewrite everything from scratch.
*Brian Goetz says Loom will kill webflux. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you should believe him blindly, but at least listen to what he has to say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;rsquo;t like reactors (I don&amp;rsquo;t like the actor model either, but it at least behaves better and is easier to understand). I really like the blocking code and the per-request model of threads. They are readable and take full advantage of the Java language. These frameworks eliminate that, and you need a good reason to use them after Loom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-words&#34;&gt;Final Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is a big topic and there is a lot to deal with. I hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful. I will also link to all the resources below and further reading so you can do your own research if needed. loom is still in pre-release and things may change, but one thing is for sure, we will get virtual threads in JDK 19 and the official release date, as I write this, is September 2022. Unfortunately, Java 19 is not LTS, and if you work for companies that only use the LTS version, you will have to wait for Java 21 which should be released in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to avoid memory leaks in java programs</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-out-of-memory/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 15:45:08 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-out-of-memory/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Although jvm has a garbage collection mechanism, if the program is written without paying attention to some specific rules, it can still lead to memory leaks in java programs, which may end up with OutOfMemory exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-causes-of-memory-leaks-in-java&#34;&gt;1. Causes of memory leaks in Java&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Objects in java are divided into 2 types in terms of usage, referenced and unreferenced. Garbage collection only recovers objects that are not referenced. Referenced objects, even if they are no longer used, are not recycled. Therefore, if the program has a large number of referenced and useless objects, there is a memory leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-java-heap-memory-heap-leak&#34;&gt;2. java heap memory (Heap) leak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size of jvm heap memory is specified by two parameters -Xms and -Xmx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;21-objects-referenced-by-static-members&#34;&gt;2.1 Objects referenced by static members&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory leaks are caused when large objects are referenced by static members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;nextDouble&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ArrayList is a dynamically allocated object on the heap and will normally be reclaimed by gc after use, but in this example, being referenced by the static member list, which is not reclaimed, will cause this very large ArrayList to remain in heap memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you need to pay special attention to the way static members are used and avoid static members referencing large objects or objects of collection type (like ArrayList etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;22-strings-intern-method&#34;&gt;2.2 String&amp;rsquo;s intern method&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling String.intern() method on a large string, intern() will place the String in jvm&amp;rsquo;s memory pool (PermGen ), which is not gc. Therefore, if a large String calls the intern() method, it will generate a large amount of memory that cannot be gc, resulting in a memory leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you must use the intern method with a large string, you should adjust the size of the PermGen memory with the -XX:MaxPermSize parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;23-not-closing-the-stream-after-reading-it&#34;&gt;2.3 Not closing the stream after reading it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Streams are often forgotten to be closed in development, which can lead to memory leaks. Because each stream corresponds to an open file handle at the OS level, streams that are not closed will cause the OS file handle to remain open, and jvm will consume memory to keep track of the OS open file handle. Example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;BufferedReader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;BufferedReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;FileReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;readLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, in versions of java prior to java8 you could add a close operation to the finally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;BufferedReader&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;BufferedReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;FileReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;readLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The try-with-resources statement can be used in java8 to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    return br.readLine();
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For network connections and database connections, etc. also pay attention to the closure of the connection. If a connection pool is used, then the closure operation is the responsibility of the connection pool and can be handled without the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;24-adding-objects-that-do-not-implement-the-hashcode-and-equals-methods-to-a-hashset&#34;&gt;2.4 Adding objects that do not implement the hashCode() and equals() methods to a HashSet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a simple but very common scenario. Normally a Set will filter duplicate objects, but without the hashCode() and equals() implementations, duplicate objects will keep getting added to the Set and never have a chance to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore a good programming practice to add implementations of the hashCode() and equals() methods to all classes. This can be easily done with Lombok&amp;rsquo;s @EqualsAndHashCode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-methods-for-finding-memory-leaks&#34;&gt;3. Methods for finding memory leaks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;31-logging-gc-logs&#34;&gt;3.1 Logging gc logs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By specifying -verbose:gc in the jvm parameter, you can log the details of each gc, which can be used to analyze the memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;32-performing-profiling&#34;&gt;3.2 Performing profiling&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory analysis is performed through Visual VM or Java Mission Control that comes with jdk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;33-code-review&#34;&gt;3.3 Code review&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discover the error codes that cause memory leak problems through code review and static code inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-summary&#34;&gt;4. Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code level inspection can help find some of the memory leaks, but memory leaks in production environments are often not easy to find in advance because many of the problems only occur in large concurrency scenarios. Therefore stress testing with stress testing tools is also needed to detect potential memory leaks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ElasticSearch new version of JavaClient using the introduction</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/elasticsearch-javaclient/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 13:24:03 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/elasticsearch-javaclient/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The java client used by ElasticSearch before version 7.17 was the Java REST Client, but since version 7.17, the Java REST Client has been officially marked as deprecated and the new version of the Java Client is recommended. This article introduces the new version of the ElasticSearch Java Client&amp;rsquo;s basic usage. The specific code reference &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/qihaiyan/springcamp/tree/master/elasticsearch-javaclient&#34;&gt;Example project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-overview&#34;&gt;I. Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch 7.17 version of the new Java API Client has the following advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strong typing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;synchronous and asynchronous calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;streaming and functional calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seamless integration with Jackson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;encapsulated connection pooling, retry, json serialization and other common capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii-adding-dependencies-to-the-project&#34;&gt;II. Adding dependencies to the project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add dependencies to the project&amp;rsquo;s gradle or maven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a java client corresponding to the class ElasticsearchClient&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a JSON object mapper for the serialization and deserialization of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the underlying Transport communication&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Java virtual thread (LOOM) and thread fairness</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-virtual-thread-fair/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Project Loom ( JEP 425 ) is probably one of the most anticipated additions to Java ever. Its implementation of virtual threading (or &amp;ldquo;green threading&amp;rdquo;) ensures that developers can create highly concurrent applications, such as those with hundreds of thousands of open HTTP connections, adhering to the well-known thread-per-request programming model without resorting to less familiar and often more complex reactive methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only recently, after several years of effort, has Loom been merged into the main line of the OpenJDK and made available as a preview feature in the latest Java 19 early access release. That is, now is the perfect time to get in touch with virtual threading and explore the new features. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share an interesting aspect I learned about thread scheduling fairness for CPU-intensive workloads running on Loom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-loom&#34;&gt;Project Loom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, some background. The problem with the classical per-request thread model is that it only scales up to a certain point. Threads managed by the operating system are an expensive resource, which means you can typically have up to a few thousand, but not hundreds of thousands or even millions. Now, for example, if a Web application makes a blocking request to a database, the thread that made that request is blocking. Of course, other threads can be scheduled on the CPU at the same time, but there can&amp;rsquo;t be more concurrent requests than there are threads available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reactive programming model addresses this limitation by releasing threads during blocking operations such as file or network IO, while allowing other requests to be processed. Once the blocking call completes, the request in question will continue, using threads again. This model allows for more efficient use of thread resources to handle IO-intensive workloads, but unfortunately comes at the cost of a more complex programming model that many developers are not familiar with. In addition, as described in the Loom JEP, aspects such as debuggability or observability can be more challenging for a responsive model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This explains the great excitement and anticipation in the Java community for Project Loom, which introduces the concept of virtual threads, &lt;em&gt;virtual threads&lt;/em&gt; dispatched by the JVM to &lt;em&gt;carrier threads at the operating system level.&lt;/em&gt; If application code encounters a blocking method, Loom will &lt;em&gt;offload&lt;/em&gt; the virtual thread from the current carrier to make room for other virtual threads. Virtual threads are cheap and managed by the JVM, meaning that you can have many, if not millions. The beauty of this model is that developers can stick to the familiar per-request thread programming model without running into scaling problems due to the limited number of threads available. I highly recommend you read Project Loom&amp;rsquo;s JEP, which is well written and provides more details and background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scheduling&#34;&gt;Scheduling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now how does Loom&amp;rsquo;s scheduler know that a method is blocking? As it turns out, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. I learned from Ron Pressler, lead author of Project Loom, that the opposite is true: the blocking methods in the JDK have been tuned for Loom to release OS-level carrier threads when called by virtual threads: the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron&amp;rsquo;s response led to a very interesting discussion with Tim Fox (of Vert.x fame, for example): what happens if the code is not IO-bound but CPU-bound? That is, if the code in a virtual thread runs some heavy computation without calling any of the JDK&amp;rsquo;s blocking methods, will the virtual thread be offloaded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, the current answer is: no. This means that CPU-constrained code actually behaves very differently in a virtual thread than it does in an OS-level thread. So let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at the phenomenon with the following sample program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shutdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;awaitTermination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;HOURS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a traditional cached thread pool, i.e. OS-level threads, about 64 threads are started at the same time. Each thread counts 100M (&lt;code&gt;BigInteger&lt;/code&gt; is used to make it more CPU intensive) and then prints out the time it took from scheduling the thread to completing it. Here are the results for my Mac Mini M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/05/31/a7574174dcc64978818fd72508f834ba.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In wall clock time, it takes about 16 seconds to complete all 64 threads. These threads are scheduled equally between the available cores on my machine. That is, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a &lt;em&gt;fair scheduling scheme&lt;/em&gt;. Now here are the results of using virtual threads (by getting the executor &lt;code&gt;Executors::newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/05/31/866efd3052284f07909ffc0c2904959b.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph looks very different. The first 8 threads took about 2 seconds of wall clock time, the next 8 threads took about 4 seconds, and so on. Since the executing code does not encounter any of the JDK&amp;rsquo;s blocking methods, threads never yield and thus usurp their carrier threads until they run out. This represents an &lt;em&gt;unfair scheduling scheme&lt;/em&gt; for threads. Although they are all started at the same time, only 8 are actually executed in the first two seconds, the next 8 are executed, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loom&amp;rsquo;s scheduler uses as many carrier threads as there are CPU cores available by default; I have eight cores in my M1, so processing takes place in blocks of eight virtual threads at a time. Using the &lt;code&gt;jdk.virtualThreadScheduler.parallelism&lt;/code&gt; system property, you can adjust the number of carrier threads, for example to 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/05/31/6e381088d45f48dfa5b61c80d17f72b4.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for fun, let&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Thread::sleep()&lt;/code&gt; add a call to (blocking method) in the processing loop and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;      &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;RuntimeException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, we&amp;rsquo;re back to fair scheduling, with all threads completing after roughly the same wall clock time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/05/31/d70e5e608b7745ab93018a96d9b79dc2.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the actual durations look more coordinated compared to our original results running with 64 OS-level threads. It seems that the Loom scheduler does a better job of allocating available resources between virtual threads. Surprisingly, calling to &lt;code&gt;Thread::yield()&lt;/code&gt; does not have the same result. While the scheduler is free to ignore this intent based on the method&amp;rsquo;s JavaDoc, Sundararajan Athijegannathan says this will be applied by Loom. It would certainly be interesting to know why this is not the case here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discussion&#34;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing these results, the big question is of course whether this unfair scheduling of CPU-intensive threads in Loom is problematic in practice. Ron and Tim have debated this point extensively, and I suggest you check it out for yourself to form an opinion. According to Ron, support for conceding program execution points (rather than blocking methods) has been implemented in Loom, but this is not merged into the main thread with the initial drop of Loom. If the current behavior proves to be problematic, it should be easy to bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for CPU-constrained code (which also doesn&amp;rsquo;t use virtual threads to begin with), it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense to overuse more threads than are physically supported by a given CPU. But in any case, it is worth pointing out that CPU-constrained code may behave differently on virtual threads than on classic OS-level threads. This may come as a surprise to Java developers, especially if the author of such code is not responsible for choosing the thread executor/scheduler actually used by the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time will tell if we need yield support for CPU-bound code, either by supporting explicit calls to &lt;code&gt;Thread::yield()&lt;/code&gt; (which I think should be supported at least) or by more implicitly, e.g. by yielding when a safety point is reached. As far as I know, Go&amp;rsquo;s goroutine has supported yield in similar scenarios since version 1.14, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised to see Java and Loom eventually go the same route.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java introduces static images to solve problems like slow running</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-oracle-leyden/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 13:40:53 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-oracle-leyden/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent social media post, Mark Reinhold, Chief Architect of Oracle&amp;rsquo;s Java Platform Group, officially announced the launch of the &amp;ldquo;Leyden&amp;rdquo; project. The project is said to have been approved and will alleviate slow startup and performance issues by introducing &amp;ldquo;static images&amp;rdquo; on the Java platform, designed to accelerate the creation of Java businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/05/26/1e91ca4f04114eb4bd36119e75c22553.png&#34; alt=&#34;message&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is understood that the &amp;ldquo;Leyden&amp;rdquo; project was first proposed around May 2020 and has been discussed for more than 2 years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Mark Reinhold published a post on a Java mailing list about the work he was proposing and leading, stating that &amp;ldquo;this work, called the &amp;ldquo;Leyden&amp;rdquo; project, will be implemented by introducing &amp;ldquo;static images&amp;rdquo; into the Java platform and the Java Development Kit (JDK). The work, called the &amp;ldquo;Leyden&amp;rdquo; project, will address these pain points by introducing the concept of &amp;ldquo;static images&amp;rdquo; into the Java platform and the Java Development Kit (JDK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leyden-project-introduces-static-images&#34;&gt;Leyden Project Introduces &amp;ldquo;Static Images&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called &amp;ldquo;static image&amp;rdquo; introduced in the &amp;ldquo;Leyden&amp;rdquo; project is an application-independent program that derives from an application running that application and not from another application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A static image is a &amp;ldquo;closed world&amp;rdquo; with respect to the classes it can load: at runtime, classes cannot be loaded from outside the image, nor can they be created dynamically. The closed world constraint severely limits the natural dynamics of Java, especially with respect to runtime reflection and the ability to load classes, on which many existing Java frameworks and libraries rely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these constraints not only reduce the size of images and their startup time, but they also &amp;ldquo;allow aggressive Ahead-of-time compilation, which is the compilation of high-level programming languages (such as C or C++) into native machine code, to reduce the time it takes for images to reach peak performance. The act of generating a binary file that can be executed natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leyden-project-to-accelerate-java-optimization-efforts&#34;&gt;Leyden Project to Accelerate Java Optimization Efforts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leyden is described as a new project that builds on past projects, including the GNU Compiler for Java and the native imaging capabilities of GraalVM, a high-performance runtime optimized for performance in a variety of languages (e.g., Java and JVM languages, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, etc.), and GraalVM is a high-performance runtime optimized for performance in a variety of languages (such as Java and JVM languages, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, etc.) and interoperability for multilingual or multi-language applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/05/26/bb026c1bd3054fa5b713f658cf215816.png&#34; alt=&#34;message&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Leyden project was inspired by GraalVM, the two projects share common components that may (or may not) make their way into the mainstream Java specification. However, due to a lack of further information at this time, some observers believe that the two projects are intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2020 when the Leyden project was first proposed, Longmeado Omdia analyst Bradley Shimmin commented, &amp;ldquo;The Leyden project seems like it should be part of the GraalVM project, and I believe the authors want it to be, because it achieves the same goals that GraalVM supports Except here, they propose to create an extremely streamlined runtime environment for a single application.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The Valhalla project is an ongoing effort by Oracle to introduce value types, a mechanism that allows Java programs to manage data more efficiently at runtime.) Oracle says the entire performance landscape will change when the Valhalla project is finally incorporated into the JDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, other members of the larger Java community have expressed interest in and anticipation of the Leyden project. Earlier, Rich Sharples, Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s Senior Director of Product Management, noted that the project is &amp;ldquo;designed to provide much of what we need from the OpenJDK&amp;rsquo;s own Graal/SubstrateVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;deep-improvements-to-the-java-platform-officially-the-first-step&#34;&gt;Deep improvements to the Java platform: Officially the first step&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not all applications will fit well within these two constraints of the &amp;ldquo;static image&amp;rdquo; of the Leyden project, and not all developers will be willing to accept this constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all in all, Mark Reinhold did not start out with closed-world constraints, but rather explored a set of constraints to come up with an incremental approach that results in optimizations that may be weaker than the closed-world constraints, but that should apply to a wider range of existing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Mark Reinhold officially announced the launch of the &amp;ldquo;Leyden&amp;rdquo; project in a May 20 OpenJDK article &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s time to take the first step and start the It&amp;rsquo;s time to take the first step and start the project,&amp;rdquo; and is intended to accelerate the creation of Java businesses through the &amp;ldquo;Leyden&amp;rdquo; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Reinhold said, &amp;ldquo;Work will be done step-by-step along the scope of the above constraints, starting small and simple to enable deeper understanding of the changes needed for the Java platform specification. &amp;ldquo;In doing so, efforts will also be made to maintain Java&amp;rsquo;s core values of readability, compatibility and universality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Reinhold also added that in the long run, the Leyden project developers will likely adopt the constraints of a completely closed world to generate completely static images. In the meantime, the project will also largely support existing JDK components such as JVM hotspots, C2 compilers, shared class and application data, and JLink code tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use of CyclicBarrier in java concurrency</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-cyclicbarrier-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 13:48:54 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-cyclicbarrier-use/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CyclicBarrier&lt;/code&gt; is a thread-safe component introduced in java 5. It has the concept of a barrier, which is used to wait for all threads to finish executing before performing a specific operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have many threads and each thread computes some data, then we need to wait for all the threads to finish executing and then add up the data computed by each thread to the final result, then we can use &lt;code&gt;CyclicBarrier&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;methods-of-cyclicbarrier&#34;&gt;Methods of CyclicBarrier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the constructor of CyclicBarrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;parties&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;parties&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;parties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;parties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;barrierCommand&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;barrierAction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;CyclicBarrier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;parties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;parties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;CyclicBarrier has &lt;code&gt;two constructors&lt;/code&gt;, the first accepts only one parameter, indicating the number of threads that need to act in unison. The second parameter is called barrierAction, indicating that the departure barrier is the method that needs to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the barrierAction is a Runnable, in which we can define the last work to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look again at the important await method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Await also has two methods, one with a time parameter and one without a time parameter, it essentially calls the &lt;code&gt;lock.newCondition().await()&lt;/code&gt; method, We consider two cases below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-thread-is-not-the-last-thread-to-call-await&#34;&gt;The thread is not the last thread to call await&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the thread will enter the wait state until the following condition is sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The last thread called await()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another thread interrupts the current thread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other thread interrupts the other thread that is waiting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other threads time out while waiting for the barrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reset() method called by other thread on that barrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the thread has set the &lt;code&gt;interrupted&lt;/code&gt; state when calling await(), or is interrupted while waiting, then an InterruptedException will be thrown and the interrupted state will be cleared. (This is consistent with Thread&amp;rsquo;s interrupt() method)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any thread is in the wait state, the barrier is reset at that time. Or if the barrier is broken while the thread is calling the await method or is waiting, then a BrokenBarrierException will be thrown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any thread is &lt;code&gt;interrupted&lt;/code&gt; while waiting, then all other waiting threads will throw a BrokenBarrierException and the barrier will be set to the broken state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-the-thread-is-the-last-one-to-call-the-await-method&#34;&gt;If the thread is the last one to call the await method&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, if the barrierAction is not empty, then the thread will call the barrierAction before the other threads continue execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the action throws an exception, then the state of the barrier will be set to broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at the &lt;code&gt;reset()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We generate a random integer queue in a sub-thread, and when all the threads have been generated, we add up all the generated integers. See how this is done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define the subthread that generates the integer queue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Use of CountDownLatch in java concurrency</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-countdownlatch-use/</link>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In java concurrency, it is very important to control access to shared variables, sometimes we also want to control the order of execution of concurrent threads, for example: wait for all threads to finish executing before executing another thread, or wait for all threads to be ready before starting the execution of all threads, This time we can use &lt;code&gt;CountDownLatch&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;CountDownLatch&lt;/code&gt; contains a counter that is placed in the &lt;code&gt;QueuedSynchronizer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an explanation of QueuedSynchronizer, you can see the previous article&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-aqs-principle-1/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AbstractQueuedSynchronizer implementation principle - 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;countdown()&lt;/code&gt; method is called, the counter will be decremented by one. Then &lt;code&gt;await()&lt;/code&gt; is called to wait for the counter to go to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;countDown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we give two examples of usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-main-thread-waits-for-all-the-child-threads-to-finish-before-it-starts-running&#34;&gt;The main thread waits for all the child threads to finish before it starts running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we define the subthread class, in which we pass in a CountDownLatch to count, and then call the countDown method of that CountDownLatch before the subthread finishes. Finally, in the main thread, we call the await() method to wait for the end of the execution of the child thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wait-for-all-threads-to-be-ready-before-executing-together&#34;&gt;Wait for all threads to be ready before executing together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we have the main thread waiting for the child threads, so in this example, we will see how the child threads wait together until they are ready and then execute together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple, after the child thread starts, the counter of the waiting child thread is subtracted by one, the counter is waited for in the main thread, and after the counter goes to zero, the main thread then notifies the child thread to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;outputScraper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output results are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;07:41:47.861 [main] INFO ThreadWaitThreadUsageTest - [Workers ready, Counted down, Counted down, Counted down, Counted down, Counted down, Counted down, Workers complete]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;stop-countdownlatchs-await&#34;&gt;Stop CountdownLatch&amp;rsquo;s await&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we call the await() method, it will wait until count=0 before finishing. However, if an exception occurs during thread execution, the countdown method may not execute. Then the await() method may wait indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time we can use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

      <title>Java stream common operations on streams</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-stream-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 May 2022 17:04:19 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-stream-use/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, starting from Java8, jdk has added a new Stream class to complement the collection class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stream provides a higher-order abstraction of Java collection operations and expressions using an intuitive way similar to querying data from a database with SQL statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This style treats the collection of elements to be processed as a stream, which travels through the pipeline and can be processed at the nodes of the pipeline, such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flow of operations is as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;+--------------------+ +------+ +------+ +--+ +-------+
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;| stream of elements +-----&amp;gt; |filter+-&amp;gt; |sorted+-&amp;gt; |map+-&amp;gt; |collect|
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;+--------------------+ +------+ +------+ +--+ +-------+
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting the Stream API can greatly improve the productivity of Java programmers, allowing them to write efficient, clean and concise code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we will do a comparison with the actual daily development programming style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iteration-operations&#34;&gt;Iteration operations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;iterating-over-collections&#34;&gt;Iterating over collections&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In everyday development, we often need to iterate through the elements of the collection object, for example, we will use the following way to iterate through the elements, and then filter out the set of a field, jdk7 operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/**
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; * jdk7 Get a collection of user IDs from a collection object
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; * @param userList
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; * @return
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;getUserIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userIds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getUserId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Stream programming is used, with a single line of code, you can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/**
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; * jdk8 Get a collection of user IDs from a collection object
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; * @param userList
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; * @return
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt; */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;getUserIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userIds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;getUserId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Collectors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;toList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userIds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;filter-elements&#34;&gt;filter elements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering elements is something you often encounter in everyday development, for example, in jdk7, we would do something like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-collection-to-map-operation&#34;&gt;The collection to Map operation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the actual development process, there is also one of the most frequently used operation is that a primary key field in the collection elements as &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;, elements as &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, to achieve the needs of the collection to map, this demand in the data assembly is used very much, * ** especially in the company prohibit even table sql query operations, view data assembly can only be achieved at the code level ** .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the following code, the role table is associated with the role group ID information, when querying the role information, the role group name also needs to be displayed and processed, using the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; method to match, which will be very efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;collection-to-map-no-grouping&#34;&gt;Collection to map (no grouping)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In jdk7, to turn the elements in a collection to map, we usually use the following way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;getMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;userMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getUserId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In jdk8, with the stream api approach, we only need one line of code to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;set-to-map-grouping&#34;&gt;Set to map (grouping)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, there are scenarios that require us to add the same key to a collection, rather than overwrite it, which change how to do it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we use jdk7, we will probably do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in jdk8, with the stream api approach, we only need one line of code to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;paging-operations&#34;&gt;Paging operations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of stream api is not only to perform various combinations of operations on collections, but also to support paging operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the following array is sorted from smallest to largest, and after the sorting is done, 10 data are queried from the first row, as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;skip&lt;/code&gt; parameter indicates the first few rows, &lt;code&gt;limit&lt;/code&gt; indicates the number of queries, similar to page capacity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-and-match-operations&#34;&gt;Find and match operations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;stream api also supports lookups on collections, and also supports regular match mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// output 27, actually equivalent to 2 + 10 + 5 + 7 + 3, is a cumulative
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;stream api supports a very large number of operations, only a few types are listed here, specifically when using, you can refer to the official website interface documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parallel-operation&#34;&gt;Parallel operation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By parallelism, we mean that multiple tasks occur at the same point in time and are processed by different cpu&amp;rsquo;s without grabbing resources from each other; and by concurrency, we mean that multiple tasks occur at the same point in time but are processed by the same cpu and grab resources from each other&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we use &lt;code&gt;parallelStream&lt;/code&gt; to output the number of empty strings as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;List&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Arrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;asList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;abc&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;bc&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;efg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;abcd&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;jkl&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// Use parallel calculation method to get the number of empty strings
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;parallelStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;isEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, &lt;code&gt;parallel operations&lt;/code&gt; are not necessarily faster than &lt;code&gt;serial operations&lt;/code&gt;! For simple operations, with very large numbers and a multi-core server, Stream parallelism is recommended! Instead, serial operations are more reliable!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High-performance collections EnumMap and EnumSet</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-enum-collection/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 15:25:32 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-enum-collection/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This article introduces &lt;code&gt;EnumMap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;EnumSet&lt;/code&gt;, which is a collection class under the &lt;code&gt;java.util&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; structures are especially used in our daily work, and often used to store data or pass parameters, but there is no way to control the data setting of &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;, we have no idea what kind of data others will &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; into it, or if the type and number of data &lt;code&gt;Key&lt;/code&gt; of our &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt; is fixed in some scenarios, then in this case How can we improve the security and performance of the system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time we can consider using &lt;code&gt;EnumMap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EnumMap&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;, and secondly its &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; can only be an enumeration, we all know that the number of instances in the enumeration is fixed, and still pre-compiled, so to a large extent to ensure the security of the data, but also to improve the performance of certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enummap&#34;&gt;EnumMap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to use &lt;code&gt;EnumMap&lt;/code&gt;, first we need to create an enumeration &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;enumMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;RED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;red&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;enumMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;BLUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;enumMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;BLUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see that we need to pass in an enum class when constructing &lt;code&gt;EnumMap&lt;/code&gt;, and the subsequent &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; are the same as &lt;code&gt;Map&lt;/code&gt;, except that this time the &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; must be the enum instance when &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; is used. Next, let&amp;rsquo;s look at how the &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; methods of &lt;code&gt;EnumMap&lt;/code&gt; are implemented, and looking at the &lt;code&gt;JDK&lt;/code&gt; source code we can see that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;typeCheck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;ordinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;oldValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;vals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;vals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;maskNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;oldValue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;unmaskNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;oldValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; is done, type checking is done first and if the passed in enum is not an enum or not the enum specified during construction, an exception will be thrown here. When the type check is passed, the index of the enumeration instance is obtained by the &lt;code&gt;ordinal()&lt;/code&gt; method of the enumeration, which returns an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; value, and the returned value is related to the order of the enumeration when it is written. RED.ordinal()&lt;code&gt;will return 1. Once the index is obtained, the&lt;/code&gt;value` value will be placed in the corresponding array position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get the data, just get the index directly from &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt; and then remove the data from the array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;isValidKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;unmaskNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;vals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Enum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;ordinal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()])&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see that the efficiency of &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; of the whole &lt;code&gt;EnumMap&lt;/code&gt; is very high, both are directly directed to process based on index in a one-dimensional array. So you can try to use this approach to improve performance in similar scenarios in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enumset&#34;&gt;EnumSet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at &lt;code&gt;EnumSet&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EnumSet&lt;/code&gt; is a collection used to manipulate &lt;code&gt;Enum&lt;/code&gt;, an abstract class that has two inherited classes, &lt;code&gt;JumboEnumSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RegularEnumSet&lt;/code&gt;. To use it, you need to determine the enumeration type. An empty &lt;code&gt;EnumSet&lt;/code&gt; can be created and used later by the following way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;enumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;BLUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;enumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;RED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;enumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The construction of &lt;code&gt;EnumSet&lt;/code&gt; is a bit more involved, we can create empty sets, and we can also create a complete set directly, there is no need to create an empty one and then do the &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; operation, as follows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;EnumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;enumSet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;EnumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;allOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;enumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, as mentioned earlier, the &lt;code&gt;ordinal()&lt;/code&gt; method of enumeration is used, so when constructing an &lt;code&gt;EnumSet&lt;/code&gt; we can also construct only all the enumeration values between the specified two enumeration ranges, and note here that the enumeration of the second argument of the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; method cannot precede the first enumeration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;EnumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;BLUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;RED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use the &lt;code&gt;of&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;EnumSet&lt;/code&gt; to construct the specified enumeration set. We can find out from the source code that no matter what method is used to construct it, the bottom is to construct an empty set first and then add the corresponding enumeration elements. The logic for constructing an empty set is as follows. Here we can see that when the number of enumerations is greater than 64, the subclass &lt;code&gt;JumboEnumSet&lt;/code&gt; is used, otherwise it is the subclass &lt;code&gt;RegularEnumSet&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Enum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;EnumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;noneOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;elementType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Enum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;universe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;getUniverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;elementType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;universe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;RegularEnumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;elementType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;universe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;JumboEnumSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;elementType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;universe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other methods are the same as for a regular Set, and you can use the set in your work exactly as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today we introduced you to two uncommon, but very useful &lt;code&gt;JDK&lt;/code&gt; set classes that can still improve performance in some scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Java Discovers Annual Encryption Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-encryption-vulnerability/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Apr 2022 13:44:51 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-encryption-vulnerability/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, security researcher Khaled Nassar made public on GitHub the PoC code for a newly disclosed digital signature bypass vulnerability in Java, tracked as CVE-2022-21449.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability is known to have been discovered by Neil Madden, a researcher at security consulting firm ForgeRock, in November of last year, and was notified to Oracle the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Oracle gave the vulnerability a CVSS rating of 7.5, ForgeRock said they had privately disclosed the vulnerability when it was first discovered and rated the vulnerability a 10 on the CVSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madden explained this by saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overstate the severity of this vulnerability. If ECDSA signatures are used for any of these security mechanisms (SSL, JWT, WebAuthn) and your server is running Java versions 15, 16, 17 or 18 before the April 2022 Critical Patch Update (CPU), an attacker could easily bypass them entirely. Nearly all real-world WebAuthn/FIDO devices (including Yubikey) use ECDSA signatures, and many OIDC providers use ECDSA-signed JWTs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, information security expert Thomas Ptacek has described the vulnerability as the &lt;code&gt;encryption vulnerability of the year&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability, known as Psychic Signatures, is related to Java&amp;rsquo;s implementation of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and is present in Java versions 15, 16, 17, and 18. This is an encryption mechanism used to digitally sign messages and data to verify the authenticity of the content, and an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to forge TSL signatures and bypass authentication measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nassar attests that setting up a malicious TLS server can trick a client into accepting an invalid signature from the server, effectively allowing the rest of TLS to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability affects the following versions of Java SE and Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Java SE: 7u331, 8u321, 11.0.14, 17.0.2, 18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.5, 21.3.1, 22.0.0.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle has now fixed the vulnerability in a critical patch update bulletin and urges developers or enterprises using Java 15, 16, 17, and 18 to update as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>JDK 19 / Java 19 has proposed two features</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-jdk19-proposed/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2022 16:01:23 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-jdk19-proposed/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;p&gt;JDK 18/Java 18 has been released &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.javai.net/post/202203/jdk18&#34;&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, according to the plan JDK 19 will be released in September this year, a few days ago the official &lt;a href=&#34;https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/19&#34;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; two features that will be released in the next version. One is the Vector API, and the other is a port of the JDK to RISC-V. The former Vector API is an API that expresses vector computation and will be incubated for &lt;strong&gt;the fourth time&lt;/strong&gt; in the next Java release; the latter proposes a feature to port the JDK to the open source Linux/RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/25/9b0f780cf0a845a0bd925ef136196bf0.png&#34; alt=&#34;java.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although JDK 19 may host a large number of features such as generic generics, value objects, and record patterns, so far only two features have been officially proposed for JDK 19, the Vector API and porting to RISC-V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/25/a8108c7f48024e2dbb072158c1956f0d.png&#34; alt=&#34;jdk19-features.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the details of JEP 422, the official writeup says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISC-V is a free and open source RISC Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) originally designed by the University of California, Berkeley, and now developed collaboratively under the auspices of RISC-V International. It is already supported by a wide range of language toolchains. With the growing popularity of RISC-V hardware, a port of the JDK would be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, officials say that the Linux/RISC-V port will only support RISC-V&amp;rsquo;s RV64GV configuration, which is a generic 64-bit ISA, and will consider supporting other RISC-V configurations in the future, such as a generic 32-bit configuration (RV32G).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the official release schedule, JDK 19 will be released in GA on September 20, preceded by Rampdown phases on June 9 and July 21, and release candidates on August 11 and August 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like JDK 18, JDK 19 will be a short-term release, with only six months of support. The current latest LTS release is JDK 17 on September 14, 2021, and the next LTS release will be JDK 21 in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In modern computer systems, there can be multiple CPUs, and each CPU can have multiple cores. In order to take full advantage of the capabilities of modern CPUs, JAVA introduced multithreading, where different threads can run on different CPUs or different CPU cores at the same time. However, for JAVA programmers it is possible to control how many threads are created, but which CPU the threads are running on is generally difficult to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if different CPU cores are scheduling the same thread, there may be a performance loss due to CPU switching. Normally this loss is relatively small, but if your application is particularly concerned about the loss caused by CPU switching, then you can try Java Thread Affinity today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-to-java-thread-affinity&#34;&gt;Introduction to Java Thread Affinity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java thread Affinity is used to bind threads in JAVA code to specific CPU cores to improve the performance of your program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, to interact with the underlying CPU, java thread Affinity must use JAVA and native methods for interaction, JNI is the official JAVA and native methods for interaction, but JNI is more cumbersome to use. So java thread Affinity actually uses JNA, JNA is a library for interacting with native methods based on JNI improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s introduce a few concepts in the CPU, respectively, &lt;code&gt;CPU&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;CPU socket&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CPU core&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the CPU, the full name of the CPU is central processing unit, also known as the central processing unit, is the key core used for task processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is CPU socket? The so-called socket is the slot where the CPU is inserted, if you have assembled a desktop computer, you should know that the CPU is installed on the socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU Core refers to the number of cores in the CPU. A long time ago, CPUs were single-core, but with the development of multi-core technology, a CPU can contain multiple cores, and the cores in the CPU are the real business processing units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are on a linux machine, then you can check the CPU status of your system by using the &lt;code&gt;lscpu&lt;/code&gt; command as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the above output we can see that this server has one socket, one core per socket, and each core can handle 1 thread at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This CPU information can be called CPU layout. in linux CPU layout information is stored in /proc/cpuinfo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java Thread Affinity, there is a CpuLayout interface that corresponds to this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;socketId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;coreId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;threadId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the CPU layout information, AffinityStrategies provides some basic Affinity policies to arrange the distribution relationship between different threads, mainly the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    SAME_CORE - Runs in the same core.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    SAME_SOCKET - runs in the same socket, but not on the same core.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    DIFFERENT_SOCKET - runs in a different socket
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    DIFFERENT_CORE - runs on a different core
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    ANY - any case is fine
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These policies are also distinguished based on the socketId and coreId of the CpuLayout. Let&amp;rsquo;s take SAME_CORE as an example and press its specific implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CpuLayout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuLayout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;cpuLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;socketId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;socketId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;coreId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;coreId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affinity policies can be sequential, the policy in front will be matched first, if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t match then the second policy will be selected and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-of-affinitylock&#34;&gt;Use of AffinityLock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we look at the specific use of Affinity, the first is to get a CPU lock, before JAVA7, we can write it like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;acquireLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;     &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// do some work locked to a CPU.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;     &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After JAVA 7, it can be written like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;acquireLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// do some work while locked to a CPU.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquireLock method can get any available CPU for a thread. this is a coarse-grained lock. if you want to get a fine-grained core, you can use acquireCore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;acquireCore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// do some work while locked to a CPU.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;acquireLock also has a bind parameter that indicates whether to bind the current thread to the acquired CPU lock. If the bind parameter = true, then the current thread will run on the CPU acquired in acquireLock. If the bind parameter = false, it means that acquireLock will bind at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above we mentioned the AffinityStrategy, which can be used as an argument to acquireLock:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;acquireLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityStrategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;strategies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;acquireLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;strategies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By calling the acquireLock method of the current AffinityLock, the AffinityLock associated with the previous lock strategy can be assigned to the current thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AffinityLock also provides a dumpLocks method to view the current CPU and thread binding status. Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newFixedThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;           &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityThreadFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;bg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SAME_CORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DIFFERENT_SOCKET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;++)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;\nThe assignment of CPUs is\n&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;dumpLocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shutdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;awaitTermination&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;SECONDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above code, we create a thread pool of 4 threads, the corresponding ThreadFactory is AffinityThreadFactory, name the thread pool bg, and assign 3 AffinityStrategy. The idea is to first assign to the same core, then to different sockets, and finally to any available CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the specific execution process, we submitted 12 threads, but our Thread pool only has at most 4 threads, it can be expected that only 4 threads will be bound to the CPU in the result returned by AffinityLock.dumpLocks method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;The assignment of CPUs is
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;0: CPU not available
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;1: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;2: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;3: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;4: Thread[bg-4,5,main] alive=true
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;5: Thread[bg-3,5,main] alive=true
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;6: Thread[bg-2,5,main] alive=true
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;7: Thread[bg,5,main] alive=true
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the output, CPU0 is not available. The other 7 CPUs are available, but only 4 threads are bound, which matches our previous analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;rsquo;s modify the AffinityStrategy of AffinityThreadFactory as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityThreadFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;bg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;SAME_CORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;means that threads will only be bound to the same core, because in the current hardware, a core can only support one thread binding at the same time, so it can be expected that only one thread will be bound in the end result, which runs as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;The assignment of CPUs is
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;0: CPU not available
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;1: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;2: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;3: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;4: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;5: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;6: Reserved for this application
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;7: Thread[bg,5,main] alive=true
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see that only the first thread is bound to the CPU, which matches the previous analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-the-api-to-allocate-cpus-directly&#34;&gt;Use the API to allocate CPUs directly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AcquireLock method of AffinityLock we mentioned above actually accepts a CPU id parameter, which can be used to get the lock of the incoming CPU id directly. so that subsequent threads can run on the specified CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityLock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;acquireLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;acquireLock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpuId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinityStrategies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In real time this Affinity is stored in the BitSet, the index of the BitSet is the cpu id and the corresponding value is whether to acquire the lock or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First look at the definition of the setAffinity method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;setAffinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;BitSet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;affinity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;BitSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Runtime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getRuntime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;availableProcessors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;affinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cpu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;setAffinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;affinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look again at the use of setAffinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;currentAffinity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AffinitySupport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getAffinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Affinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setAffinity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1L&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// lock to CPU 5.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that since the underlying BitSet uses Long for data storage, the index here is bit index, so we need to convert the decimal CPU index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summarize&#34;&gt;Summarize&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java Thread Affinity can control the CPU used by the Thread in the program from the JAVA code, which is very powerful and can be used by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Oracle pushed out a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html&#34;&gt;security update&lt;/a&gt; yesterday to fix a vulnerability that allowed attackers to forge certain types of SSL certificates and handshakes, two-factor authentication information, and authorization credentials generated by a range of widely used open standards. This allows an attacker to easily digitally sign files and other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/22/df5b24ee1b4e43719eb64016006ebfcc.png&#34; alt=&#34;java.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability affects the implementation of ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) in Java 15 and above. ECDSA is an algorithm that uses elliptic curve cryptography principles to digitally authenticate messages. A key advantage of ECDSA over RSA or other cryptographic algorithms is that it generates smaller keys, making it ideal for use in standards including FIDO-based 2FA, SMAL, and OpenID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2022-21449 and was originally discovered by ForgeRock security researcher Neil Madden, who wrote about it in &lt;a href=&#34;https://neilmadden.blog/2022/04/19/psychic-signatures-in-java/&#34;&gt;Vulnerability Description&lt;/a&gt; writes that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use ECDSA signatures in these security mechanisms, and if your server is running any Java version 15, 16, 17, or 18 before the April 2022 Critical Patch Update (CPU), an attacker can easily bypass them altogether. Almost all WebAuthn/FIDO devices today (including Yubikeys) use ECDSA signatures, and many OIDC providers are also using ECDSA-signed JWTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madden notes that these affected Java versions are primarily due to their failure to check two key variables in ECDSA to ensure that they are non-zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECDSA signature relies on a pseudo-random number, usually denoted K, to derive two additional numbers, R and S. To verify that the signature is valid, the equation involving R and S must be checked. A signature is valid when both sides of the equation are equal. In order for the process to work properly, neither R nor S can be zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because if the values are both zero, both sides of the equation will always be equal, and the signature will always be valid. This means that only a blank signature needs to be submitted to successfully pass the validation check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bug was introduced when the code in question was rewritten from C++ to Java, and the vulnerability dates back as far as the release of Java 15 in 2020. The bug was discovered and reported to Oracle last November, and Oracle fixed the issue in the April Critical Patch Update (CPU) that was rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle rated the vulnerability as a 7.5 out of 10 for severity in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, but Madden rated the vulnerability as a 10 for severity based on his own assessment. In addition to Madden&amp;rsquo;s assessment that the vulnerability is very serious, another security expert, Thomas Ptacek, named the vulnerability &lt;strong&gt;Crypto bug of the year&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/22/2baee5d65938477f9344365bac60da80.png&#34; alt=&#34;crypto-bug.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 15 and above is not as widely used by developers as earlier versions of Java. Data from security firm Snyk in 2021 showed that Java 15 had only a 12% share at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Father of Java: Don&#39;t Stick with Java 8</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-not-stick-java8/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;James Gosling, the father of Java, recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/errcraft/status/1516461479062429701&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; that developers should abandon JDK 8 as soon as possible and opt for JDK 17 LTS, which brings huge improvements in every aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/22/07c9b2ea36e8401985d317008ba005e4.png&#34; alt=&#34;stick-java8.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe the father of Java was just promoting Corretto, the OpenJDK distribution for his boss AWS. and he suggests that developers still using JDK 8 might consider using Corretto&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/corretto/corretto-8/releases/tag/8.332.08.1&#34;&gt;new version&lt;/a&gt;- -Includes all the latest updates and CVE defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corretto is a distribution of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cn/blogs/opensource/amazon-corretto-no-cost-distribution-openjdk-long-term-support&#34;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; OpenJDK 8, which supports multiple platforms and can run on both cloud and local computers. The Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) is run on each Corretto release to ensure compatibility with the Java SE platform. &lt;strong&gt;Corretto can be used as a direct replacement for Java SE distributions&lt;/strong&gt; without using features that are not available in the OpenJDK, such as Java Flight Recorder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Basic use of ThreadPool</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-thread-pool/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 14:42:24 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-thread-pool/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java, threads are the counterpart of system threads and are used to handle a range of system resources. The number of threads that can be opened is limited in both windows and linux, so if you create unlimited threads in your java program, you will encounter a situation where no threads can be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPU cores are limited and if there are multiple threads running at the same time, the CPU will rotate according to the priority of the threads and allocate a specific amount of CPU time to each thread. So more threads are not better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two interfaces that represent the management of ThreadPool: ExecutorService and Executor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps we take to run a thread are generally like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an ExecutorService.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit the task to the ExecutorService.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ExecutorService schedules the thread to run the task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw a diagram to represent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/javaisland/images/2022/04/20/60ee44b9fc4048df81dbb61efb220f3c.png&#34; alt=&#34;threadPool.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I will talk about how to use ThreadPool in java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;executors-executor-and-executorservice&#34;&gt;Executors, Executor and ExecutorService&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executors provide a set of easy methods to help us create ThreadPool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Executor interface defines a method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;Executor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;/*
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     * Executes the given command at some time in the future.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     * may execute in a new thread, in a pooled thread, or in the calling
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     The command * may execute in a new thread, in a pooled thread, or in the calling * thread, at the discretion of the {@code Executor} implementation.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     *@param command the runnings.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     * @param command the runnable task
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     * @throws RejectedExecutionException if this task cannot be
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     * accepted for execution
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     * @throws NullPointerException if command is null
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cm&#34;&gt;     */&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExecutorService inherits from Executor and provides more thread pool operations. It is a complement to Executor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the principle of interface implementation separation, we usually use ExecutorService or Executor in java code instead of specific implementation classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to create an Executor and ExecutorService through Executors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newSingleThreadExecutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;in Executor&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executorService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newCachedThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executorService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;in ExecutorService&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executorService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shutdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;threadpoolexecutor&#34;&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor is an implementation of the ExecutorService interface, which can add a more fine-grained configuration to the thread pool, specifically it can control these three parameters: corePoolSize, maximumPoolSize, and keepAliveTime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoolSize is the number of threads in the pool, and corePoolSize represents the minimum number of threads to be initialized and maintained in the pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are too many threads waiting, maximumPoolSize can be set to provide the maximum number of threads in the pool, so that the pool will create more threads for task execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;keepAliveTime is the time that extra threads will wait for unassigned tasks. After that time, the thread will be reclaimed by the thread pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to create a ThreadPoolExecutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;threadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;0L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;MILLISECONDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Runnable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;threadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;submitted through threadPoolExecutor&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;threadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shutdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example we create the ThreadPoolExecutor by using the constructor of the ThreadPoolExecutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking Executors already have many implementations of ThreadPoolExecutor built in, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the following example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newFixedThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;executor1 poolsize {}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getPoolSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;executor1 queuesize {}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getQueue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shutdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example we Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2) to create a ThreadPoolExecutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example we have submitted 3 tasks, but our pool size is only 2. So there is still a 1 that cannot be executed immediately and needs to wait in the queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newCachedThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;executor2 queue size {}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;getQueue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;shutdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example we used Executors.newCachedThreadPool() to create a ThreadPoolExecutor. After running it we can see that poolsize is 3 and queue size is 0. This means that newCachedThreadPool will automatically increase pool size automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the thread is not activated in 60 seconds or so, it will be retracted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Queue here is a SynchronousQueue, since insertion and removal are basically done at the same time, so the queue size here is basically 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scheduledthreadpoolexecutor&#34;&gt;ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a very common ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor, which inherits from ThreadPoolExecutor, and implements the ScheduledExecutorService interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ThreadPoolExecutor&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ScheduledExecutorService&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ScheduledExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newScheduledThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;schedule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Hello JavaIsland&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;MILLISECONDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we defined a timed task that will be executed after 500 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier we also talked about two other very common methods of the ScheduledExecutorService.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scheduleAtFixedRate - Takes the start time as the interval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scheduleWithFixedDelay - at the end time interval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CountDownLatch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CountDownLatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ScheduledExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Executors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newScheduledThreadPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ScheduledFuture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;future&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;executor2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;scheduleAtFixedRate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;in ScheduledFuture&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;countDown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;MILLISECONDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;lock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TimeUnit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;MILLISECONDS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;future&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;cancel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;forkjoinpool&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ForkJoinPool is a new framework introduced in java 7, which we will explain in detail in a later article&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-fork-join&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;The fork join framework in java&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here is a brief introduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ForkJoinPool is mainly used to generate a large number of tasks to do algorithmic operations. If you use threads to do it, it will consume a lot of threads. But this problem does not arise in the fork/join framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fork/join, any task can generate a large number of sub-tasks, and then wait for the sub-task to finish by using join().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we give an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TreeNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TreeNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;TreeNode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Sets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;newHashSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define a TreeNode, then iterate over all values and add them up to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>The fork join framework in java</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-fork-join/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 14:33:27 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-fork-join/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fork join framework is the introduction of java 7 framework, the introduction of this framework is mainly to improve the ability of parallel computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fork join has two main steps, the first is fork, a large task into many small tasks, the second is join, the results of the first task join up to generate the final result. If there is no return value in the first step, join will wait until all the small tasks are finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we explain the fork join framework in detail from these three aspects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forkjoinpool&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ForkJoinPool is an implementation of the ExecutorService that provides some convenient management methods for worker threads and thread pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;AbstractExecutorService&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A work thread can only handle one task at a time, but instead of creating a separate thread for each task, ForkJoinPool uses a special data structure double-ended queue to store the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, a work thread takes tasks from the head of the queue assigned to it. If this queue is empty, then this work thread will take tasks from the tail of other task queues to execute, or from the global queue. This design makes full use of the work thread&amp;rsquo;s performance and improves concurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a look at how to create a ForkJoinPool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common way is to use ForkJoinPool.commonPool() to create it. commonPool() provides a common default thread pool for all ForkJoinTask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;forkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;commonPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way is to use the constructor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;forkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The argument here is the parallelism level, and 2 means that the thread pool will use 2 processor cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forkjoinworkerthread&#34;&gt;ForkJoinWorkerThread&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ForkJoinWorkerThread is the worker thread used in ForkJoinPool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nc&#34;&gt;ForkJoinWorkerThread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike normal threads it defines two variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// the pool this thread works in
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ForkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;WorkQueue&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;workQueue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;// work-stealing mechanics
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is the ForkJoinPool to which this worker thread belongs. The other is a Queue that supports work-stealing mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at its run method again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;ex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;finally&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                    &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;deregisterWorker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;exception&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it simply, it takes the task from the Queue and executes it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forkjointask&#34;&gt;ForkJoinTask&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ForkJoinTask is the type of task that runs in ForkJoinPool. We usually use two of its subclasses: RecursiveAction and RecursiveTask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They both define a compute() method that needs to be implemented to achieve specific business logic. The difference is that RecursiveAction is only used to execute tasks, while RecursiveTask can have return values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since both classes come with Recursive, the specific implementation logic will also be related to recursion, so let&amp;rsquo;s take an example of using RecursiveAction to print a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the above example, but here we need to have return values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;submitting-task-in-forkjoinpool&#34;&gt;Submitting Task in ForkJoinPool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the two tasks above, we can submit in the ForkJoinPool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;intArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CustomRecursiveTask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;customRecursiveTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;CustomRecursiveTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;intArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;forkJoinPool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;invoke&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;customRecursiveTask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the above example, we use invoke to commit, and invoke will wait for the result of the task execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we don&amp;rsquo;t use invoke, we can also replace it with fork() and join().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;fork() submits the task to the pool, but does not trigger execution. join() will actually execute and get the returned result.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daemon Thread in Java</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-daemon-thread/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2022 14:19:16 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-daemon-thread/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of threads in java, user threads and daemon threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User threads are high priority threads and the JVM will wait for all the User Threads to finish running before it finishes running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;daemon threads are low-priority threads that serve User Threads. Because daemon threads are low priority and serve only user threads, the JVM will automatically exit when all user threads are finished, regardless of whether there are still daemon threads running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this feature, we usually handle infinite loops in daemon threads because they do not affect the operation of user threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of daemon threads is not recommended for I/O operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are some improper operations that can cause daemon threads to block the JVM shutdown, such as calling the join() method in a daemon thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;application&#34;&gt;Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how to create a daemon thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 7
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt; 9
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;10
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;11
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;12
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;13
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;14
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;15
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;16
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;18
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;19
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;20
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;21

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;                &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;printStackTrace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kt&#34;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kd&#34;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;InterruptedException&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DaemonThread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;daemonThread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DaemonThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;daemonThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;setDaemon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;daemonThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a daemon thread is as simple as setting its daemon property to true after creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that setDaemon(true) must be executed before thread start(), otherwise it will throw an IllegalThreadStateException!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above example will exit immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we remove daemonThread.setDaemon(true);, then the JVM will keep running without exiting because the user thread keeps executing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the case if we run in main, what happens if we run in a @Test?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;            &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DaemonThread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;daemonThread&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;DaemonThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;daemonThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have changed the main method to @Test execution. After execution we will see that Test will end immediately, whether it is a daemon thread or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the case where a user thread is started in a daemon thread again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;        &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;daemonThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;    &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, daemonThread starts a user thread, and after running it we will see that the JVM will end execution immediately even if a user thread is running.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notes on upgrading from Java 8 to Java 11</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-jdk8-upgrade-jdk11/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 20:21:04 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-jdk8-upgrade-jdk11/</guid>
      
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;preface&#34;&gt;Preface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the latest version of Java has evolved to Java 18, most projects on the market are still using Java 8. Many people are apprehensive about upgrading their Java version because the Java API is not necessarily forward compatible from Java 8. Java 11 is the next long-supported version of Java 8, and there is no doubt that Java 11 is even better than Java 8. superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article describes the code checking tools used to convert code from Java 8 to Java 11, as well as the problems you may encounter and suggestions for resolving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-java-11-is-needed&#34;&gt;Why Java 11 is needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 11 is the next long-term supported version of Java 8, which means that Java 8 is no longer officially supported. In addition, the Java platform has changed significantly from Java 8 to Java 11, and these changes have been made to make the Java platform even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article focuses on the changes that had an impact on performance, diagnostics, and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;modules&#34;&gt;Modules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modules address configuration and packaging issues that are difficult to manage in large applications (running on classpath). A module is a self-descriptive collection of Java classes and interfaces and related resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With modules, it is possible to customize runtime configurations that contain only the components required by the application. This customization produces a small memory footprint, so the application can be statically linked to the custom runtime for deployment using jlink. This smaller memory footprint may be particularly suitable for microservice architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, the JVM can make use of modules by making class loading more efficient. The result is a smaller, lighter and faster start-up runtime. The optimization techniques used by the JVM to improve application performance can be more effective because modules can code what components are needed for a particular class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For programmers, modules can help enforce strong encapsulation by requiring explicit declarations of which packages a module can export and which components it requires, and by restricting reflective access. This level of encapsulation makes the application more secure and easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications can continue to use classpath and run on Java 11 without converting to modules that are required components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;java-network-traffic-recorder&#34;&gt;Java Network Traffic Recorder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java Flight Recorder (JFR) collects diagnostic and analytical data from running Java applications. JFR has little to no effect on running Java applications. The collected data can then be analyzed using Java Mission Control (JMC) and other tools. While both JFR and JMC are commercial features in Java 8, both are open source in Java 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;java-mission-control&#34;&gt;Java Mission Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;java Mission Control (JMC) provides a graphical display of the data collected by the java network traffic logger (JFR) and is open source in java 11. In addition to general information about the running application, JMC allows the user to drill down into the data. JFR and JMC can be used to diagnose runtime problems such as memory leaks, GC overhead, hot methods, thread bottlenecks, and blocking I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unified-logging&#34;&gt;Unified Logging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 11 has a common logging system for all components of the JVM. Users can use this unified logging system to define which components need to be logged, and to what level. This granular logging is useful for root cause analysis of JVM crashes and for diagnosing performance issues in production environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;low-overhead-heap-analysis&#34;&gt;Low Overhead Heap Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new API has been added to the Java Virtual Machine Tools Interface (JVMTI) for sampling Java heap allocations. Sampling is low overhead and can be enabled on an ongoing basis. While heap allocation can be monitored using the Java Flight Recorder (JFR), the sampling methods in JFR can only be used for allocation. JFR implementations may also fail to hit allocations. In contrast, heap sampling in Java 11 can provide information about both live and dead objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application Performance Monitoring (APM) vendors are starting to take advantage of this new feature, and the Java engineering group is investigating the possibility of using it with Azure performance monitoring tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stackwalker&#34;&gt;StackWalker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When logging, you typically get a snapshot of the current thread&amp;rsquo;s stack. The question is how many stack traces to log, and whether it is necessary to log stack traces. For example, a user may only want to see the stack trace when a specific exception occurs in a method. The StackWalker class (added in Java 9) provides a snapshot of the stack and provides ways to facilitate fine-grained programmer control over how the stack trace is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;garbage-collection&#34;&gt;Garbage collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 11 provides the following garbage collectors: Serial, Parallel, Garbage-First, and Epsilon. The default garbage collector in Java 11 is the Garbage First garbage collector (G1GC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other three collectors are mentioned here to keep the content complete. The Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) is a concurrent, low-latency collector that tries to keep the pause time below 10 milliseconds. ZGC is available as an experimental feature in Java 11. The Shenandoah recycler is a short-pause recycler that performs more garbage collection in a concurrent manner through running Java programs, thus reducing GC pause time. Shenandoah was an experimental feature in Java 12, but can be backward ported to Java 11. The Concurrent Mark and Sweep (CMS) recycler was released, but has been deprecated since the release of Java 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For general use, the JVM uses GC as the default setting. Typically, these and other GC settings need to be adjusted to optimize throughput or latency according to the requirements of the application. Proper GC tuning requires a deep understanding of GC and requires expertise from the Microsoft Java Engineering Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;g1gc&#34;&gt;G1GC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default garbage collector in Java 11 is the G1 Garbage Collector (G1GC). The goal of G1GC is to strike a balance between latency and throughput. The G1 garbage collector attempts to achieve a high throughput goal with a high probability of meeting the pause time goal. G1GC aims to avoid entire collections, but fallback to full GC occurs when concurrent recovery cannot recover memory fast enough. Full GC uses the same number of parallel worker threads as the initial mixed recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parallel-gc&#34;&gt;Parallel GC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallel recycler is the default recycler in Java 8. Parallel GC is a throughput recycler that uses multiple threads to speed up garbage collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;epsilon&#34;&gt;Epsilon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Epsilon garbage collector handles allocations, but does not reclaim any memory. When the heap is exhausted, the JVM shuts down. Epsilon is suitable for services with short lifetimes and applications that are known to have no garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;docker-container-improvements&#34;&gt;Docker container improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Java 10, the JVM did not recognize memory and CPU constraints set on the container. For example, in Java 8, the JVM would set the maximum heap size to a quarter of the physical memory of the base host by default. Starting with Java 10, the JVM uses the constraints set by container control groups (cgroups) to set memory and CPU limits (see the description below). For example, the default maximum heap size is a quarter of the container&amp;rsquo;s memory limit (e.g., if the memory limit is 2G, the maximum heap size is 500MB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;JVM option&lt;/code&gt; has also been added to give Docker container users fine-grained control over the amount of system memory used for Java heaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This support is enabled by default and is only available on Linux-based platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;multi-version-jar-files&#34;&gt;Multi-version jar files&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java 11, it is possible to create a jar file that contains multiple versions of a class file specific to a Java distribution. With multi-release jar files, library developers can support multiple versions of Java without having to deliver multiple versions of jar files. For users of these libraries, multi-release jar files solve the problem of having to match a specific jar file to a specific runtime target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-performance-improvements&#34;&gt;Other Performance Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following changes to the JVM have a direct impact on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEP 197: Segmented Code Cache - splits the code cache into segments. This segmentation improves performance by better controlling the JVM memory footprint, reducing scan time for compiled methods, and significantly reducing code cache fragmentation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEP 254: Compact string - changes the internal representation of a string from two bytes per character to one or two bytes per character, depending on the character encoding. Since most strings contain the &lt;code&gt;ISO-8859-1/Latin-1&lt;/code&gt; character, this change effectively halves the amount of space needed to store the string.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEP 310: Application Class-Data Sharing The &lt;code&gt;-Class-Data&lt;/code&gt; share reduces startup time by allowing memory mapping at runtime. Application Class-Data sharing extends class-data sharing by allowing application classes to be placed in CDS archives. This saves memory and reduces overall system response time when multiple JVMs share the same archive file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEP 312: Thread-Local Handshake - enables you to perform callbacks on threads without having to perform a global VM safepoint, which helps VMs reduce the number of global safepoints, resulting in lower latency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delayed allocation of compiler threads - In layered compilation mode, the VM will start a large number of compiler threads. On systems with many CPUs, this is the default mode. These threads are created regardless of the amount of memory available and regardless of how many compilation requests there are. The threads consume memory even when they are idle (which is almost all the time), which leads to inefficient use of resources. To solve this problem, we have changed the implementation to start only one compiler thread of each type at startup. The system will dynamically handle starting other threads and closing unused threads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following changes to the core library can affect the performance of new or modified code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEP 193: Variable Handles - Define a standard method to invoke the equivalent of various util and operations on object fields and array elements, a standard set of fencing operations for precise control of memory ordering, and a standard accessibility guard operation to ensure that referenced objects remain accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEP 269: Convenience Factory Methods for Collections - Defines library api&amp;rsquo;s that allow you to easily create instances of collections and mappings that contain a small number of elements. This is a static factory method on the collection interface for creating lean and unmodifiable instances of collections. These instances are inherently more efficient. The collections created by these APIs are represented in a concise manner, without wrapper classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEP 285: Spin-Wait hints - provides APIs that allow Java to hint that the runtime system is in a spin-loop. Some hardware platforms can take advantage of software indications that a thread is in a &amp;ldquo;busy-waiting&amp;rdquo; state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JEP 321: HTTP Client (Standard) - provides a new http client API that implements Http/2 and WebSocket, and replaces the older HttpURLConnection API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;possible-issues-with-converting-java-8-to-java-11&#34;&gt;Possible issues with converting Java 8 to Java 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When converting code from Java 8 to Java 11, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. For less critical applications, migrating from Java 8 to Java 11 can mean a significant amount of work. Potential problems include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deleted APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deprecated packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of internal APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;changes to the class loader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and changes to garbage collection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the solution is to try to run on Java 11 without recompiling, or to compile with JDK 11 first. If the goal is to get the application up and running as soon as possible, the best approach is usually to run it directly on Java 11. For libraries, the goal will be to release projects compiled and tested using JDK 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Migrating to Java 11 is worth the effort. Since the release of Java 8, several new features have been added and enhancements have been made to existing features. These features and enhancements improve startup, performance and memory usage, and provide better integration with containers. Additions and changes have also been made to the API, which can improve developer productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;toolbox&#34;&gt;Toolbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java 11 has two tools for probing potential problems: jdeprscan and jdeps. These two tools can be run on existing classes or jar files. The conversion effort can be evaluated without recompiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jdeprscan can see if a deprecated or deleted API is being used. Using a deprecated API is not a blocking issue, but is worth exploring. Is there an issue that needs to be logged to resolve the use of the deprecated API? If using the deprecated API is a blocking issue that must be resolved before you can attempt to run the application on Java 11.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;jdeps, a Java class dependency parser. When used with the &lt;code&gt;--jdk-internals&lt;/code&gt; option, jdeps tells you which class depends on which internal API. It is possible to continue using the internal APIs in Java 11, but changing this usage should be a priority. OpenJDK Wiki page &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/JDK8/Java+Dependency+Analysis+Tool&#34;&gt;Java Dependency Analysis Tool&lt;/a&gt; recommends replacements for some common JDK internal APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Gradle and Maven have jdeps and jdeprscan plugins. It is recommended that the following tools be added to the generated scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Tools&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Gradle Plugin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Maven Plugin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;jdeps&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;jdeps-gradle-plugin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Apache Maven JDeps plugin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;jdeprscan&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;jdeprscan-gradle-plugin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Apache Maven JDeprScan plugin&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Java compiler itself, javac, is another tool in the toolbox. The warnings and errors obtained from jdeprscan and jdeps come from the compiler. The advantage of using jdeprscan and jdeps is that both tools can be run on existing jar and class files (including third-party libraries). What jdeprscan and jdeps cannot do is to warn about the use of reflection to access the wrapped API. Reflection access is checked at runtime. Ultimately the code must be run on Java 11 to know exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-jdeprscan&#34;&gt;Using jdeprscan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use jdeprscan, the easiest way is to provide it with a jar file from an existing generation. You can also specify a directory (such as the compiler output directory) or a single class name for it. Use the &lt;code&gt;-release 11&lt;/code&gt; option to get the most complete list of deprecated APIs. To determine the priority of deprecated APIs to adopt, roll back the setting to &lt;code&gt;-release 8&lt;/code&gt;. Deprecated APIs in Java 8 may be removed earlier than the most recently deprecated APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;jdeprscan --release 11 my-application.jar
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jdeprscan tool generates an error message if it is unable to resolve a dependent class. For example &lt;code&gt;error: cannot find class org/apache/logging/log4j/Logger&lt;/code&gt;. It is recommended to add the dependent class to &lt;code&gt;--class-path&lt;/code&gt; or use the application &lt;code&gt;class-path&lt;/code&gt;, but the tool will continue to scan without it. The argument is &lt;code&gt;-class-path&lt;/code&gt;. Other variants of the &lt;code&gt;-class-path&lt;/code&gt; argument will not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;jdeprscan --release 11 --class-path log4j-api-2.13.0.jar my-application.jar
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;error: cannot find class sun/misc/BASE64Encoder
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;class com/company/Util uses deprecated method java/lang/Double::&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;(D)V
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This output tells us that the com.company.Util class is calling the deprecated constructor of the java.lang. javadoc will suggest an API to replace the deprecated API. There is no way to resolve the &amp;ldquo;error: cannot find class sun/misc/BASE64Encoder&amp;rdquo; issue because it is a deprecated API. Since the release of Java 8, you should Use java.util.Base64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;jdeprscan --release 11 --list&lt;/code&gt; to see the specific APIs deprecated since Java 8. To get a list of deprecated APIs, run &lt;code&gt;jdeprscan --release 11 --list --for-removal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-jdeps&#34;&gt;Using jdeps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use jdeps to find dependencies on the JDK&amp;rsquo;s internal APIs with the &lt;code&gt; --jdk-internals&lt;/code&gt; option. This example requires the &lt;code&gt;-multi-release 11&lt;/code&gt; command line option, because log4j-core-2.13.0.jar is a multi-release jar file. Without this option, jdeps will issue an error message if a multi-release jar file is found. This option specifies the version of the class file to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;17

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Please modify your code to eliminate dependence on any JDK internal APIs.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;For the most recent update on JDK internal API replacements, please check:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/JDK8/Java+Dependency+Analysis+Tool
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;JDK Internal API Suggested Replacement
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;---------------- ---------------------
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sun.misc.BASE64Encoder Use java.util.Base64 @since 1.8
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;sun.misc.Unsafe See http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/260   
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output provides some good advice on avoiding using the JDK&amp;rsquo;s internal APIs! If possible, it is recommended to use the replacement API. Provide the name of the module that wraps the package in parentheses. If you need to break the wrapper explicitly, use the module name in conjunction with &lt;code&gt;-add-exports&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-add-opens&lt;/code&gt;. Using sun.misc.BASE64Encoder or sun.misc.BASE64Decoder causes java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError in Java 11. Code using these APIs must be modified to use java.util.Base64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try not to use any APIs from the jdk.unsupported module. The APIs in this module will reference &lt;a href=&#34;https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/260&#34;&gt;JDK Enhancement Program (JEP) 260&lt;/a&gt; as a suggested replacement. In short, JEP 260 states that using the internal API will be supported until the replacement API is available. Although your code is using the JDK internal API, it will work, at least for a while. Take a look at JEP 260, as it points out certain replacements for the internal API. For example, you can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/invoke/VarHandle.html&#34;&gt;variable handle&lt;/a&gt; instead of one of the sun.misc.Unsafe APIs Unsafe API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to scanning for usage of the JDK&amp;rsquo;s internal APIs, jdeps can also perform other operations. It is a useful tool for analyzing dependencies and generating module information files. For more information, see the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-javac&#34;&gt;Using javac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you compile with JDK 11, you will need to update it to generate scripts, tools, test frameworks, and included libraries. Use javac&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;-Xlint:unchecked&lt;/code&gt; option to get usage details and other warnings for the JDK&amp;rsquo;s internal APIs. It may also be necessary to expose wrapped packages to the compiler using &lt;code&gt;-add-opens&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-add-reads&lt;/code&gt; (see JEP 261).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Libraries may be considered to be packaged as multi-version jar files. Multi-version jar files allow both Java 8 and Java 11 runtimes to be supported in the same jar file. They increase the complexity of generation. It is beyond the scope of this document to discuss how to generate multi-version jars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-on-java-11&#34;&gt;Running on Java 11&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most applications should be able to run on Java 11 without modification. The first thing to try is to run on Java 11 without recompiling the code. The purpose of running it directly is to see what warnings and errors occur when it is executed. This method allows the application to run faster on Java 11 because it minimizes those concerns that must be completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the issues you may encounter can be resolved without recompiling the code. If you need to fix the problem in your code, do so, but continue to compile with JDK 8. If possible, have the application run with java version 11 before compiling with JDK 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-command-line-options&#34;&gt;Check command line options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before running on Java 11, do a quick scan of the command line options. Removed options can cause the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to exit. This check is especially important if using the GC logging options, as they are significantly different from what was the case in Java 8. The JaCoLine tool is a good tool for checking command line options for problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-third-party-libraries&#34;&gt;Check third-party libraries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-party libraries that you do not control are a potential source of problems. You can proactively update third-party libraries to a newer version. It is also possible to see which libraries are not in use when running the application and update only those that are required. The problem with updating all libraries to the latest version is that if there is an error in the application, it is more difficult to find the root cause. Did the error occur because a library was updated? Or was the error caused by some change in the runtime? The problem with updating only what is needed is that it may take several iterations to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendation here is to make as few changes as possible and update the third-party libraries separately. If you update third-party libraries, you will often need the latest and greatest version that is compatible with Java 11. Depending on how far behind the current version is, you may need to take a more cautious approach and upgrade to the first version compatible with &lt;code&gt;Java 9+&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to checking the release notes, you can use jdeps and jdeprscan to evaluate jar files. In addition, the OpenJDK Quality Group maintains a Quality Outreach Wiki page, which lists the status of tests performed on several Free Open Source Software (FOSS) projects based on OpenJDK versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;explicitly-setting-up-garbage-collection&#34;&gt;Explicitly setting up garbage collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parallel garbage collector (parallel GC) was the default GC in Java 8. If your application uses the default, you should set the GC explicitly using the command line option &lt;code&gt;-XX:+UseParallelGC&lt;/code&gt;. The default in Java 9 has been changed to the Garbage First garbage collector (G1GC). For a fair comparison of applications running on Java 8 and Java 11, the GC setting must be the same. Experimentation with GC settings should be deferred until the application has been verified on Java 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;explicitly-set-default-options&#34;&gt;Explicitly set default options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If running on a point-of-action VM, setting the command line option &lt;code&gt;-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags&lt;/code&gt; dumps the values of the options set by the VM, specifically the default values set by the GC. Run with this flag on Java 8, and use the output options when running on Java 11. For the most part, the defaults are the same in Java 8 through 11. However, using the setting in Java 8 ensures parity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to set the command line option &lt;code&gt;--illegal-access=warn&lt;/code&gt;. In Java 11, using reflection to access the JDK internal API generates an &amp;ldquo;Illegal Reflection Access&amp;rdquo; warning. By default, the system only warns about the first illegal access. Setting &lt;code&gt;--illegal-access=warn&lt;/code&gt; causes the system to warn about every illegal reflection access. If you set the option to warn, more cases of illegal access will be found. However, you will also receive a large number of redundant warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting &lt;code&gt;--illegal-access=deny&lt;/code&gt; will simulate future behavior of the Java runtime once the application is running on Java 11. Starting with Java 16, the default setting will be &lt;code&gt;--illegal-access=deny&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;classloader-caution&#34;&gt;ClassLoader Caution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java 8, it is possible to force the system class loader to be converted to a URLClassLoader. This is typically done by applications and libraries that need to inject classes into the classpath at runtime. The class loader hierarchy has been changed in Java 11. The system class loader (also known as the application class loader) is now an internal class. Forcing a conversion to URLClassLoader raises a ClassCastException at runtime. Java 11 cannot dynamically enhance the classpath at runtime via the API, but this can be done via reflection, which displays a prominent warning about how to use the internal API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Java 11, the startup class loader only loads core modules. If you create a class loader with a null parent, it may not find all the platform classes. In Java 11, you need to pass ClassLoader.getPlatformClassLoader() instead of null as the parent class loader in such cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;region-setting-data-changes&#34;&gt;Region setting data changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default source for locale data in Java 11 has been changed to the Unicode Consortium&amp;rsquo;s public locale data repository via &lt;a href=&#34;https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/252&#34;&gt;JEP 252&lt;/a&gt;. This may affect the localized formatting. If necessary, set the system property to &lt;code&gt;java.locale.providers=COMPAT,SPI&lt;/code&gt; and revert to the Java 8 locale behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;potential-problems&#34;&gt;Potential problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some common problems that may be encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unrecognized VM options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unrecognized options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VM warning: ignore options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VM warning: option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warning: illegal reflection access operation occurred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;-Xbootclasspath/p is no longer a supported option&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unrecognized-options&#34;&gt;Unrecognized options&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a command line option is removed, the application outputs &lt;code&gt;Unrecognized option:&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Unrecognized VM option&lt;/code&gt; followed by the name of the problematic option. Unrecognized options will cause the VM to exit. Options that have been deprecated but not removed generate VM warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, there is no replacement for a deleted option, and the only way to remove it from the command line is to delete it. The exception is the garbage collection logging option. GC logging has been re-implemented in Java 9 and can be done using the Unified JVM logging framework. See the Java SE 11 Tool Reference for permission to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/java.html#GUID-BE93ABDC-999C-4CB5-A88B-1994AAAC74D5&#34;&gt;Logging via the JVM Unified Logging Framework&lt;/a&gt; section of the Java SE 11 Tool Reference, &amp;ldquo;Table 2-2 Mapping Old Garbage Collection Logging Flags to Xlog Configuration&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vm-warnings&#34;&gt;VM Warnings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a deprecated option generates a warning. When an option has been replaced or is no longer useful, it is deprecated. These options should be removed from the command line, as with the use of deleted options. &amp;ldquo;VM Warning: Option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web Page VM Options Explorer provides an exhaustive list of options that have been added or removed in Java since JDK 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;error-unable-to-create-java-virtual-machine&#34;&gt;Error: Unable to create Java Virtual Machine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This error message is output when the JVM encounters an unrecognized option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warning-illegal-reflection-access-operation-occurred&#34;&gt;Warning: Illegal Reflection Access Operation Occurred&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Java code uses reflection to access the JDK&amp;rsquo;s internal APIs, an &amp;ldquo;Illegal Reflection Access&amp;rdquo; warning is issued at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WARNING: Illegal reflective access by my.sample.Main (file:/C:/sample/) to method sun.nio.ch.Util.getTemporaryDirectBuffer(int)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of com.company.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that the module is not exporting a package that is accessible via reflection. This package is wrapped in the module and is essentially an internal API. When starting and running an application on Java 11, the first action is likely to be to ignore this warning. The Java 11 runtime allows reflection access, so older code can continue to run. To resolve this warning, look for updated code that does not use the internal API. If you cannot resolve the issue with updated code, you can use the &lt;code&gt;-add-exports&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-add-opens&lt;/code&gt; command line options to enable access to packages. These options allow access to the unexported types of another module from one module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--add-exports&lt;/code&gt; option allows the target module to access the public types of the named packages of the source module. Sometimes, code will use setAccessible(true) to access non-public members and APIs. This is called deep reflection. In this case, use &lt;code&gt;--add-opens&lt;/code&gt; to allow the code to access the non-public members of the package. If you are not sure whether to use &lt;code&gt;--add-exports&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--add-opens&lt;/code&gt;, start with &lt;code&gt;--add-exports&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;--add-exports&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;--add-opens&lt;/code&gt; options should be viewed as a stop-gap solution, not a long-term solution. Using these options breaks the encapsulation of the module system, which is designed to prevent the JDK internal API from being used. If the internal API is removed or changed, the application will fail. Java 16 will deny reflection access except when access is enabled via command line options such as &lt;code&gt;-add-opens&lt;/code&gt;. To simulate future behavior, set &lt;code&gt;--illegal-access=deny&lt;/code&gt; on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning in the above example is issued because the sun.nio.ch package is not exported by the java.base module. In other words, there is no exports sun.nio.ch; in the module-info.java file of the module java.base. This can be fixed with &lt;code&gt;--add-exports=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED&lt;/code&gt;. Classes not defined in the module implicitly belong to the unnamed module, which is literally named ALL-UNNAMED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;javalangreflectinaccessibleobjectexception&#34;&gt;java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exception instructs you to try to call setAccessible(true) on a field or method of an encapsulated class. You may also receive an &amp;ldquo;illegal reflection access&amp;rdquo; warning. Use the &lt;code&gt;-add-opens&lt;/code&gt; option to give code access to non-public members of the package. The exception message will tell you that the module did not open the package to the module trying to call setAccessible. If the module is an &lt;code&gt;unnamed module&#39;&#39;, use UNNAMED-MODULE as the target module in the&lt;/code&gt;-add-opens`&amp;rsquo; option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException: Unable to make field private final java.util.ArrayList jdk.internal.loader.URLClassPath. loaders accessible: 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;module java.base does not &amp;#34;opens jdk.internal.loader&amp;#34; to unnamed module @6442b0a6
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;$ java --add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.loader=UNNAMED-MODULE example.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;javalangnoclassdeffounderror&#34;&gt;java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NoClassDefFoundError is most likely caused by splitting a package or referencing a deleted module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;noclassdeffounderror-caused-by-splitting-a-package&#34;&gt;NoClassDefFoundError caused by splitting a package&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a package is found in multiple libraries, it is a split package. The symptom of the split package problem is that you know a class will be on the class-path, but cannot find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem only occurs when using &lt;code&gt;module-path&lt;/code&gt;. The Java module system optimizes class lookup by restricting packages to a named module. When performing a class lookup, the runtime will give priority to &lt;code&gt;module-path&lt;/code&gt; over &lt;code&gt;class-path&lt;/code&gt;. If a package is split between a module and &lt;code&gt;class-path&lt;/code&gt;, only that module will be used to perform class lookups. This may result in a NoClassDefFound error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check for split packages, a simple way is to insert the module path and class path into jdeps, using the path to the application class file as . If there is a split package, jdeps will output a warning: &lt;code&gt;Warning: split package:&lt;/code&gt;. This can be fixed by adding the split package to the named module using &lt;code&gt;-patch-module =[,]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;noclassdeffounderror-caused-by-using-java-ee-or-corba-modules&#34;&gt;NoClassDefFoundError caused by using Java EE or CORBA modules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an application is running on Java 8 but raises java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError or java.lang.ClassNotFoundException, it is possible that the application is using packages from a Java EE or CORBA module. These modules were deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve this issue, add a runtime dependency to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-xbootclasspathp-is-no-longer-a-supported-option&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;-Xbootclasspath/p&lt;/code&gt; is no longer a supported option&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support for &lt;code&gt;-Xbootclasspath/p&lt;/code&gt; has been removed. Please use &lt;code&gt;--patch-module&lt;/code&gt; instead. The &lt;code&gt;-patch-module&lt;/code&gt; option is described in JEP 261. Look for the section labeled &amp;ldquo;Patch Module Contents&amp;rdquo;. You can use &lt;code&gt;-patch-module&lt;/code&gt; with javac and java to rewrite or enhance classes in a module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In effect, &lt;code&gt;-patch-module&lt;/code&gt; performs the operation of inserting the patch module into the module system&amp;rsquo;s class lookup. The module system will first fetch the classes from the patch module. This has the same effect as prepending the bootclasspath in Java 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unsupportedclassversionerror&#34;&gt;UnsupportedClassVersionError&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exception indicates that you are trying to run code compiled with a higher version of Java on a lower version of Java. For example, running its jar on Java 11 is a program compiled using JDK 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;td&gt;53&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;54&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;55&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;56&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;13&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;57&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running the application on Java 11, consider moving the library out of &lt;code&gt;class-path&lt;/code&gt; and then into &lt;code&gt;module-path&lt;/code&gt;. Find the updated version of the library on which the application depends. Select the module library (if available). Use module-path whenever possible, even if you do not intend to use modules in your application. Use &lt;code&gt;module-path&lt;/code&gt; for better class loading performance than &lt;code&gt;class-path&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

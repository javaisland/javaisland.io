      <title>Introduction to the Range function in Java</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202207/range-function/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202207/range-function/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In Java, the Range method is available in both the IntStream and LongStream classes. In the IntStream class it helps to return the sequential value of the IntStream in the range of function parameters. In this method, startInclusive(inclusive) and endExclusive(exclusive) are the two parameters used with the incremental step which, as mentioned before, will include the start value and exclude the end value. In the case of LongStream, the only difference is the addition of the LongStream value.</description>

      <description>Background  Implemented a basic component can intercept all http requests, the request header/parameter/body/response, etc. for printout. Here the most critical and most difficult to deal with is the output of the body, because the transmission of characters in the body is obtained through the HttpServletRequest byte stream getInputStream (); and this byte stream does not exist after reading once. For example, the use of open source frameworks such as Spring some links have been intercepted to read the input stream, that after our custom interceptor to intercept the print body, the InputStream has no bytes &amp;hellip; The implementation of the idea is not difficult, is their own inheritance to achieve HttpServletRequestWrapper, a copy of the body to save a good, and then in the Filter chain transfer can be.</description>

      <description>Log4j &amp;ldquo;nuclear-grade&amp;rdquo; vulnerability Log4Shell may affect the world forever.
 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity Review Board (CSRB) recently released its investigative report in response to last year&amp;rsquo;s Log4Shell vulnerability.
 The CSRB is an agency established by DHS only this February to investigate major cybersecurity incidents and provide reports containing recommendations to enhance the nation&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity. The CSRB&amp;rsquo;s first investigation was into the &amp;ldquo;nuclear-grade&amp;rdquo; vulnerability that erupted in Log4j last year.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202207/jump-table/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Jump table is a data structure for storing a sorted list of elements with the help of a linked table hierarchy connected to a subsequence of elements. Jump table allows to handle item lookups in an efficient way. A jump table is a probabilistic data structure, which means that it skips several elements of the entire list, hence the name. We can think of a jump table as an extended version of a linked table.</description>

      <title>The difference between the delete() method and deleteOnExit() method in Java.io.</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202207/io-delete/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 18 Jul 2022 10:59:30 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202207/io-delete/</guid>
      <description>delete () method Deletes a file directly when the delete () method is called, regardless of whether the file exists or not, and executes it as soon as it is called.
deleteOnExit () method When the deleteOnExit () method is called, it is only equivalent to a declaration of deleteOnExit (), and the deleteOnExit () method is really called when the program is finished running and the JVM is terminated to achieve the delete operation.</description>

      <description>1. What is a floating point number? A floating point number is a type of data used by computers to represent decimals, using scientific notation. In java, double is a double-precision, 64-bit, floating-point number, and the default is 0.0d. float is a single-precision, 32-bit floating-point numbers, default is 0.0f.
Storing in memory
float sign bit (1 bit) exponent (8 bit) mantissa (23 bit) double sign bit (1 bit) exponent (11 bit) mantissa (52 bit)</description>

      <description>Java is one of the most popular programming languages today and is perennially in the top three of the most popular programming languages. A good java programmer cannot develop safer and more efficient code without knowledge of testing frameworks. One of the most important reasons for using these testing frameworks is to reduce the possibility of errors, increase development efficiency, and reduce development costs. In this article, we will introduce the most common testing frameworks used for Java testing.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202207/java-proxy/</guid>
      <description>1. Proxy Pattern The proxy pattern is a relatively well understood design pattern. Simply put we use a proxy object to replace access to the real object (real object), so that we can provide additional functional operations to extend the functionality of the target object without modifying the original target object.
The main purpose of the proxy pattern is to extend the functionality of the target object, for example, you can add some custom operations before and after the execution of a method of the target object.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-futuretask/</guid>
      <description>Java&amp;rsquo;s multithreading mechanism essentially accomplishes two things, asynchronous computation and concurrency. Concurrency is solved by a series of APIs that address thread safety; asynchronous computation, on the other hand, is commonly used with Runnable and Callable in conjunction with threads.
FutureTask is a cancelable asynchronous callable API based on the Runnable implementation.
Basic usage Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation, and is executed via the ExecutorService&amp;rsquo;s Future&amp;lt;? &amp;gt; submit(Runnable task) method of the ExecutorService, which is used as the return value.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-class-api/</guid>
      <description>The Java community is working on a Classfile API proposal that aims to provide an API for parsing, generating, and converting Java class files; initially as an internal replacement for the ASM in the JDK, and later as a public API. It is planned that ASM will eventually be removed from the JDK entirely.
The proposal notes that class file generation, parsing, and detection are ubiquitous in the Java ecosystem; many tools and libraries need to be able to handle class files, and frameworks often perform on-the-fly bytecode instrumentation, transformation, and generation.</description>

      <description>Introduction In java, we can convert a specific set into a stream, so in some cases, such as in a test environment, we need to construct a stream with a certain number of elements, how do we need to handle it?
Here we can construct an unlimited stream and then call the limit method to limit the number returned.
Basic use Let&amp;rsquo;s start with an example of using Stream.iterate to create an infinite Stream.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-parallel-stream-thread-pool/</guid>
      <description>Introduction By default, ForkJoinPool creates a thread for each processor, and parallelStream will use this shared thread pool to submit tasks if not specified.
So how do we handle a specific situation where we want to use a custom ForkJoinPool?
Common operations If we want to do an addition from 1 to 1000, we can use parallel stream like this.
1 2 3 4 5  List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; integerList= IntStream.range(1,1000).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList()); ForkJoinPool customThreadPool = new ForkJoinPool(4); Integer total= integerList.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-cloud-compiler/</guid>
      <description>Azul has introduced a new cloud-native compiler, Java Cloud Compiler, which offloads Java JIT compilation from local systems to elastic resources, reducing the amount of resources needed to run applications and shortening the time to peak performance.
Understanding JIT and AOT The Java Runtime is a completely self-reliant system designed to run and improve code on a single system. The runtime works through just-in-time (JIT) compilation, using native resources that convert Java bytecode (JAR and class files) into native code to improve speed and memory.</description>

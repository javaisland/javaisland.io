      <description>Information indicates that an RCE 0day vulnerability has been reported in the Spring Framework. If the target system is developed using Spring and has a JDK version above JDK9, an unauthorized attacker can exploit this vulnerability to remotely execute arbitrary code on the target device.
1. Vulnerability Situation Analysis The Spring framework is the most widely used lightweight open source framework for Java, and in the JDK9 version of the Spring framework (and above), a remote attacker can obtain an AccessLogValve object through the framework&amp;rsquo;s parameter binding feature and use malicious field values to trigger the pipeline mechanism and write to a file in an arbitrary path if certain conditions are met.</description>

      <description>I. What is DoS? DoS is short for Denial of Service, which means denial of service. The attack that causes DoS is called a DoS attack, and its purpose is to make the computer or network unable to provide normal services. Denial of Service exists on various web services, this web service can be implemented in c, c++, or go, java, php, python, and other languages.
II. Status of Java DoS In various open source and closed source java system products, we often see announcements about DoS defects, most of which are CPU exhaustion type or business offload type DoS.</description>

      <description>Zero-copy in the Linux operating system Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the general I/O process of Linux This is a procedure that reads from a disk file and writes to it via socket, and the corresponding system call is as follows.
1 2  read(file, tmp_buf, len); write(socket, tmp_buf, len);   The program uses the read() system call to change the system from user state to kernel state, and the data from the disk is read into the kernel buffer by means of DMA (Direct memory access).</description>

      <description>Jenkins, an open source Devops tool, announced: Starting with the June 28th release of Jenkins 2.357 and the upcoming September LTS release, Jenkins requires Java 11 as a minimum.
Originally known as Hudson, Jenkins is a venerable continuous integration tool that has been in existence for over a decade. Since its inception in 2005, the Jenkins project has undergone several Java migrations. The current migration from Java 8 to Java 11 is consistent with the migration history in the Jenkins project.</description>

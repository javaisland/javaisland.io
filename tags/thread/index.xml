      <title>The use of ThreadLocal in java</title>

      <description>Preface ThreadLocal is mainly used to store data for the current thread, this data is only accessible by the current thread.
When defining a ThreadLocal, we can also define specific types of objects stored in the ThreadLocal.
1  ThreadLocal&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; threadLocalValue = new ThreadLocal&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();   Above we have defined a ThreadLocal object that stores an Integer.
To store and get the object in ThreadLocal is also very simple, using get() and set().</description>

      <title>The difference between Runnable and Callable in java</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-runnable-callable/</link>

      <description>Preface In java&amp;rsquo;s multi-threaded development Runnable has always been the core of multi-threading, and Callable is an enhanced version of java 1.5 added in.
In this article, we will explore the differences between Runnable and Callable in detail.
Operation mechanism First look at the interface definition of Runnable and Callable:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  @FunctionalInterface public interface Runnable { /** * When an object implementing interface &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Runnable&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is used * to create a thread, starting the thread causes the object&amp;#39;s * &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;run&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; method to be called in that separately executing * thread.</description>

      <title>The use of ExecutorService in java concurrency</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-executorservice-use/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-executorservice-use/</guid>
      <description>Preface ExecutorService is a framework for asynchronous execution in java. By using ExecutorService you can easily create a multi-threaded execution environment.
This article will explain in detail the specific use of ExecutorService.
Creating an ExecutorService Generally speaking, there are two ways to create an ExecutorService.
The first way is to use the factory class methods in Executors, for example.
1  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);   In addition to the newFixedThreadPool method, Executors contains a number of methods to create an ExecutorService.</description>

      <title>The use of Future in java</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-future-use/</link>

      <description>The use of Future in java Future is an interface introduced in java 1.5 that can be used to get asynchronous results easily. This article will explain how to use Future through specific examples.
Creating Future As mentioned above, Future represents the result of asynchronous execution, which means that when the asynchronous execution is finished, the returned result will be saved in Future.
So when do we use Future? Generally speaking, when we execute a long-running task, using Future allows us to temporarily deal with other tasks, and then return the result when the long task is finished.</description>

      <title>Synchronized keywords in java concurrency</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-synchronized/</link>

      <description>Introduction In a multi-threaded environment, we often encounter resource competition, such as multiple threads going to modify the same shared variable at the same time, it is necessary to perform some processing of the resource access method to ensure that only one thread accesses it at the same time.
Java provides the synchronized keyword to facilitate us to achieve the above operation.
Why synchronized Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example where we create a class that provides a setSum method.</description>

      <title>Difference between wait and sleep in java</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-wait-sleep/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-wait-sleep/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In this post, we will discuss the difference between wait() and sleep() methods in java. And discuss how to use these two methods.
Difference between wait and sleep wait() is a native method defined in Object.
1  public final native void wait(long timeout) throws InterruptedException;   So every instance of the class can call this method. wait() can only be called in a synchronized block. It will release the lock put on the object when it is synchronized.</description>

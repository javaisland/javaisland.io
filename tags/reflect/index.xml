      <description>Preface In our practical development, we often use reflection, I present an example of the logging function done by reflection in practical development.
Traditional logging Some basic knowledge about reflection can be found in Reflection Primer.
I believe that logging is not new to you, in the actual development of some more sensitive data tables we need to record every operation of it.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the traditional way of writing.</description>

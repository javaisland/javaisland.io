      <title>Practical application scenarios for pipeline stream</title>

      <description>Preface PipedInputStream and PipedOutputStream are designed to solve cross-thread byte data transfers. They always come in pairs and can only be used on two different threads, using piped input and output streams in one thread can cause deadlocks. In some business scenarios, using pipeline streams will increase the speed of file uploads and reduce CPU and IO overhead, this is very practical, so this article talks about Practical application scenarios for pipeline stream.</description>

      <title>Principle of implementation of atomic operations</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/atomic-principle/</link>

      <description>1. Introduction Atomic means &amp;ldquo;the smallest particle that cannot be further divided&amp;rdquo;, and atomic operation means &amp;ldquo;an operation or series of operations that cannot be interrupted&amp;rdquo;. Implementing atomic operations on a multiprocessor becomes a bit complicated. In this article, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how atomic operations are implemented on Intel processors and in Java.
2. Definition of Terms Compare and Swap CAS operations require two values to be entered, an old value (the value before the desired operation) and a new value, during which the old value is compared to the new value if it has not changed, and not exchanged if it.</description>

      <title>Thread pool rejection policy</title>

      <description>Preface When it comes to java thread pools nothing is more familiar than the ExecutorService interface. jdk1.5 adds java.util.concurrent package under this api, which greatly simplifies the development of multi-threaded code. Whether you use FixedThreadPool or CachedThreadPool the implementation behind it is ThreadPoolExecutor. threadPoolExecutor is a typical product of cache pooling design, because the pool has a size, when the pool volume is not enough to carry, it involves a rejection policy.</description>

      <title>Java reflection mechanism</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202203/java-reflect/</link>

      <description>What is Reflection In the runtime state, for any class, you can know all the properties and methods of the class; for any object, you can call any of its methods and properties; this dynamically obtained information and dynamic invocation of the object&amp;rsquo;s methods is called the reflection mechanism of the Java language. So what can we do with reflection?
 Analyze classes at runtime. Look at objects at runtime. We can also use reflection to write a toString method for all classes to use.</description>

      <title>A scenario using Threadlocal to solve concurrency and efficiency problems</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202203/threadlocal-use/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202203/threadlocal-use/</guid>
      <description>ThreadLocal is a tool provided by JDK 1.2, a tool mainly to solve the problem of sharing resources under multi-threaded, In the next section, we will analyze how ThreadLocal can be used to solve concurrency problems and improve code efficiency in development, starting from the definition of ThreadLocal and its application scenarios.
Scenario 1, ThreadLocal is used to save objects that are unique to each thread, creating a copy for each thread so that each thread can modify the copy it owns without affecting the other threads&amp;rsquo; copies, ensuring thread safety.</description>

      <title>Oracle cracks down on Java licensing issues, enterprises remove JDK overnight</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202203/oracle-java-license/</link>

      <description>According to a report in the foreign media The Register and feedback from major enterprises, Oracle has recently begun to include Java in its software licensing review, with the aim of Oracle&amp;rsquo;s move is an effort to push companies to pay, an operation it routinely employs to boost payment rates.
Oracle introduced two licensing models for Java SE. In April 2019, Oracle began charging a license fee for Java that was previously free, which requires users to pay for a subscription to a commercial Java SE product in order to receive patches and updates.</description>

      <title>A common defect in java systems - Memory DoS</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202203/memory-dos/</link>

      <description>I. What is DoS? DoS is short for Denial of Service, which means denial of service. The attack that causes DoS is called a DoS attack, and its purpose is to make the computer or network unable to provide normal services. Denial of Service exists on various web services, this web service can be implemented in c, c++, or go, java, php, python, and other languages.
II. Status of Java DoS In various open source and closed source java system products, we often see announcements about DoS defects, most of which are CPU exhaustion type or business offload type DoS.</description>

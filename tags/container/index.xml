      <description>In a previous article, I mentioned the problem of Java program containers generating a lot of zombie processes. Today I ran into it again, but in a different way.
The zombie processes are also generated by a bash script, but this script is executed in the K8S readinessProbe and livenessProbe, not by the java program itself.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at some failure diagrams.
You can see that there are many timeout processes that are not cleaned up after execution.</description>

      <description>Recently I encountered a problem, a Java process using Runtime().exec() to execute script files, creating a large number of zombie processes, while the Java process is running in the container.
At that time, I saw this situation on the Host machine, and I could see that there were a large number of zombie processes.
Locate the zombie process by ps aux | grep Z.

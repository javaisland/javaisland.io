Although the vulnerability is not in Tomcat itself, the Apache Tomcat team has also released versions 10.0.20, 9.0.62 and 8.5.78 with it, which are the official Tomcat solutions for the reported CVE-2022-22965 vulnerability, which has been addressed in the above versions, for older The above version has resolved the CVE-2022-22965 vulnerability, and for older, unsupported versions of Spring Framework, the vulnerability can be circumvented by upgrading the Tomcat version.</description>

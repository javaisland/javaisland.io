      <description>Undirected rings An undirected graph with rings is shown below, where there are two rings, 0-2-1-0 and 2-3-4-2, respectively.
To detect rings in an undirected graph, you can use depth-first search. Suppose we start from vertex 0, then walk to the adjacent vertex 2, then walk to the vertex 1 adjacent to vertex 2. Since vertex 0 and vertex 1 are adjacent and vertex 0 is labeled, it means we have spared a loop, so there is a loop in the undirected graph.</description>

      <description>Basic concepts Definition of a graph A graph is a binary consisting of a set of points V={vi}V={vi} and a set E={ek}E={ek} of unordered pairs of elements in VV, denoted G=(V,E)G=(V,E), elements vivi in VV are called vertices and elements ekek in EE are called edges.
For two points u,vu,v in VV, if the edge (u,v)(u,v) belongs to EE, then the two points u,vu,v are said to be adjacent and u,vu,v is called the endpoint of the edge (u,v)(u,v).</description>

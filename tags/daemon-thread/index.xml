      <description>Preface There are two types of threads in java, user threads and daemon threads.
User threads are high priority threads and the JVM will wait for all the User Threads to finish running before it finishes running.
daemon threads are low-priority threads that serve User Threads. Because daemon threads are low priority and serve only user threads, the JVM will automatically exit when all user threads are finished, regardless of whether there are still daemon threads running.</description>

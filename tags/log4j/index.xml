      <description>Log4j &amp;ldquo;nuclear-grade&amp;rdquo; vulnerability Log4Shell may affect the world forever.
 The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity Review Board (CSRB) recently released its investigative report in response to last year&amp;rsquo;s Log4Shell vulnerability.
 The CSRB is an agency established by DHS only this February to investigate major cybersecurity incidents and provide reports containing recommendations to enhance the nation&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity. The CSRB&amp;rsquo;s first investigation was into the &amp;ldquo;nuclear-grade&amp;rdquo; vulnerability that erupted in Log4j last year.</description>

      <description>Virtual threading is something I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about. It&amp;rsquo;s a long-awaited feature in the language and we&amp;rsquo;ve made very few attempts to implement it in the past, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally here and it&amp;rsquo;s been merged into Java 19. This means that it will be included as a preview feature and we will be able to use it as soon as JDK 19 is released.
As I read this article I had to browse through many posts and videos.</description>

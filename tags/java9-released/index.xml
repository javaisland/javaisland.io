      <description>Overview In Java 9, the underlying String object has been changed from char[] to byte[], which has the immediate benefit of being more memory-efficient, hence the name Compact Strings Improvement. Because in Java char takes up 2 bytes and byte takes up 1 byte, while a Unicode character does not necessarily need 2 bytes to be represented, at least ASCII characters only need 1 byte to be done. That is, if your string is full of ASCII characters, half the space would be wasted if you use char.</description>

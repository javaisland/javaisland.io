      <description>The Java community is working on a Classfile API proposal that aims to provide an API for parsing, generating, and converting Java class files; initially as an internal replacement for the ASM in the JDK, and later as a public API. It is planned that ASM will eventually be removed from the JDK entirely.
The proposal notes that class file generation, parsing, and detection are ubiquitous in the Java ecosystem; many tools and libraries need to be able to handle class files, and frameworks often perform on-the-fly bytecode instrumentation, transformation, and generation.</description>

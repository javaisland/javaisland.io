      <description>ThreadLocal is a tool provided by JDK 1.2, a tool mainly to solve the problem of sharing resources under multi-threaded, In the next section, we will analyze how ThreadLocal can be used to solve concurrency problems and improve code efficiency in development, starting from the definition of ThreadLocal and its application scenarios.
Scenario 1, ThreadLocal is used to save objects that are unique to each thread, creating a copy for each thread so that each thread can modify the copy it owns without affecting the other threads&amp;rsquo; copies, ensuring thread safety.</description>

      <description>I. What is DoS? DoS is short for Denial of Service, which means denial of service. The attack that causes DoS is called a DoS attack, and its purpose is to make the computer or network unable to provide normal services. Denial of Service exists on various web services, this web service can be implemented in c, c++, or go, java, php, python, and other languages.
II. Status of Java DoS In various open source and closed source java system products, we often see announcements about DoS defects, most of which are CPU exhaustion type or business offload type DoS.</description>

      <description>Instructions In project development, in order to ensure the security of data and user privacy, we usually encrypt key information, this article details how to use hutool in java language to quickly encrypt and decrypt data, hope you can help.
If your project is built on Maven, you can introduce Hutool through pom to use the encryption and decryption function.

      <description>Zero-copy in the Linux operating system Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the general I/O process of Linux This is a procedure that reads from a disk file and writes to it via socket, and the corresponding system call is as follows.
1 2  read(file, tmp_buf, len); write(socket, tmp_buf, len);    The program uses the read() system call to change the system from user state to kernel state, and the data from the disk is read into the kernel buffer by means of DMA (Direct memory access).</description>

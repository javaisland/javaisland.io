      <description>Java is one of the most popular programming languages today and is perennially in the top three of the most popular programming languages. A good java programmer cannot develop safer and more efficient code without knowledge of testing frameworks. One of the most important reasons for using these testing frameworks is to reduce the possibility of errors, increase development efficiency, and reduce development costs. In this article, we will introduce the most common testing frameworks used for Java testing.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202207/java-proxy/</guid>
      <description>1. Proxy Pattern The proxy pattern is a relatively well understood design pattern. Simply put we use a proxy object to replace access to the real object (real object), so that we can provide additional functional operations to extend the functionality of the target object without modifying the original target object.
The main purpose of the proxy pattern is to extend the functionality of the target object, for example, you can add some custom operations before and after the execution of a method of the target object.</description>

      <title>Java Multithreaded Concurrent FutureTask</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-futuretask/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-futuretask/</guid>
      <description>Java&amp;rsquo;s multithreading mechanism essentially accomplishes two things, asynchronous computation and concurrency. Concurrency is solved by a series of APIs that address thread safety; asynchronous computation, on the other hand, is commonly used with Runnable and Callable in conjunction with threads.
FutureTask is a cancelable asynchronous callable API based on the Runnable implementation.
Basic usage Future represents the result of an asynchronous computation, and is executed via the ExecutorService&amp;rsquo;s Future&amp;lt;? &amp;gt; submit(Runnable task) method of the ExecutorService, which is used as the return value.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-infinite-stream/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In java, we can convert a specific set into a stream, so in some cases, such as in a test environment, we need to construct a stream with a certain number of elements, how do we need to handle it?
Here we can construct an unlimited stream and then call the limit method to limit the number returned.
Basic use Let&amp;rsquo;s start with an example of using Stream.iterate to create an infinite Stream.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-parallel-stream-thread-pool/</guid>
      <description>Introduction By default, ForkJoinPool creates a thread for each processor, and parallelStream will use this shared thread pool to submit tasks if not specified.
So how do we handle a specific situation where we want to use a custom ForkJoinPool?
Common operations If we want to do an addition from 1 to 1000, we can use parallel stream like this.
1 2 3 4 5  List&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; integerList= IntStream.range(1,1000).boxed().collect(Collectors.toList()); ForkJoinPool customThreadPool = new ForkJoinPool(4); Integer total= integerList.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-cloud-compiler/</guid>
      <description>Azul has introduced a new cloud-native compiler, Java Cloud Compiler, which offloads Java JIT compilation from local systems to elastic resources, reducing the amount of resources needed to run applications and shortening the time to peak performance.
Understanding JIT and AOT The Java Runtime is a completely self-reliant system designed to run and improve code on a single system. The runtime works through just-in-time (JIT) compilation, using native resources that convert Java bytecode (JAR and class files) into native code to improve speed and memory.</description>

      <title>Java Virtual Threads</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-virtual-thread/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-virtual-thread/</guid>
      <description>Virtual threading is something I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about. It&amp;rsquo;s a long-awaited feature in the language and we&amp;rsquo;ve made very few attempts to implement it in the past, but it&amp;rsquo;s finally here and it&amp;rsquo;s been merged into Java 19. This means that it will be included as a preview feature and we will be able to use it as soon as JDK 19 is released.
Most of the content on the virtual (green) threads is written by non-Java developers, why is that?</description>

      <title>How to avoid memory leaks in java programs</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-out-of-memory/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202206/java-out-of-memory/</guid>
      <description>Although jvm has a garbage collection mechanism, if the program is written without paying attention to some specific rules, it can still lead to memory leaks in java programs, which may end up with OutOfMemory exceptions.
1. Causes of memory leaks in Java Objects in java are divided into 2 types in terms of usage, referenced and unreferenced. Garbage collection only recovers objects that are not referenced. Referenced objects, even if they are no longer used, are not recycled.</description>

      <title>Java virtual thread (LOOM) and thread fairness</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-virtual-thread-fair/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-virtual-thread-fair/</guid>
      <description>Project Loom ( JEP 425 ) is probably one of the most anticipated additions to Java ever. Its implementation of virtual threading (or &amp;ldquo;green threading&amp;rdquo;) ensures that developers can create highly concurrent applications, such as those with hundreds of thousands of open HTTP connections, adhering to the well-known thread-per-request programming model without resorting to less familiar and often more complex reactive methods.
Only recently, after several years of effort, has Loom been merged into the main line of the OpenJDK and made available as a preview feature in the latest Java 19 early access release.</description>

      <title>Use of CyclicBarrier in java concurrency</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-cyclicbarrier-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 13:48:54 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-cyclicbarrier-use/</guid>
      <description>Introduction CyclicBarrier is a thread-safe component introduced in java 5. It has the concept of a barrier, which is used to wait for all threads to finish executing before performing a specific operation.
If we have many threads and each thread computes some data, then we need to wait for all the threads to finish executing and then add up the data computed by each thread to the final result, then we can use CyclicBarrier.</description>

      <title>Use of CountDownLatch in java concurrency</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-countdownlatch-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 13:34:16 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-countdownlatch-use/</guid>
      <description>Introduction In java concurrency, it is very important to control access to shared variables, sometimes we also want to control the order of execution of concurrent threads, for example: wait for all threads to finish executing before executing another thread, or wait for all threads to be ready before starting the execution of all threads, This time we can use CountDownLatch.
CountDownLatch contains a counter that is placed in the QueuedSynchronizer.</description>

      <title>Java stream common operations on streams</title>
      <link>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-stream-use/</link>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202205/java-stream-use/</guid>
      <description>Introduction As we all know, starting from Java8, jdk has added a new Stream class to complement the collection class.
Stream provides a higher-order abstraction of Java collection operations and expressions using an intuitive way similar to querying data from a database with SQL statements.
This style treats the collection of elements to be processed as a stream, which travels through the pipeline and can be processed at the nodes of the pipeline, such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, etc.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-enum-collection/</guid>
      <description>This article introduces EnumMap and EnumSet, which is a collection class under the java.util package.
The Map and Set structures are especially used in our daily work, and often used to store data or pass parameters, but there is no way to control the data setting of Map, we have no idea what kind of data others will put into it, or if the type and number of data Key of our Map is fixed in some scenarios, then in this case How can we improve the security and performance of the system?</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-thread-pool/</guid>
      <description>Preface In Java, threads are the counterpart of system threads and are used to handle a range of system resources. The number of threads that can be opened is limited in both windows and linux, so if you create unlimited threads in your java program, you will encounter a situation where no threads can be created.
CPU cores are limited and if there are multiple threads running at the same time, the CPU will rotate according to the priority of the threads and allocate a specific amount of CPU time to each thread.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-fork-join/</guid>
      <description>Preface Fork join framework is the introduction of java 7 framework, the introduction of this framework is mainly to improve the ability of parallel computing.
Fork join has two main steps, the first is fork, a large task into many small tasks, the second is join, the results of the first task join up to generate the final result. If there is no return value in the first step, join will wait until all the small tasks are finished.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-daemon-thread/</guid>
      <description>Preface There are two types of threads in java, user threads and daemon threads.
User threads are high priority threads and the JVM will wait for all the User Threads to finish running before it finishes running.
daemon threads are low-priority threads that serve User Threads. Because daemon threads are low priority and serve only user threads, the JVM will automatically exit when all user threads are finished, regardless of whether there are still daemon threads running.</description>

      <guid>https://www.javai.net/post/202204/java-jdk8-upgrade-jdk11/</guid>
      <description>Preface Although the latest version of Java has evolved to Java 18, most projects on the market are still using Java 8. Many people are apprehensive about upgrading their Java version because the Java API is not necessarily forward compatible from Java 8. Java 11 is the next long-supported version of Java 8, and there is no doubt that Java 11 is even better than Java 8. superior.
This article describes the code checking tools used to convert code from Java 8 to Java 11, as well as the problems you may encounter and suggestions for resolving them.</description>
